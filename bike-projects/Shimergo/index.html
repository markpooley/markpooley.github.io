    		<p>The flashiest bike I own is a 1974 Schwinn Voyageur II. I've come across three of these frames so far. I don't ride this one all that much - maybe because it's so flashy...</p>

        <h3 class='bike'>A Gift from my Uncle</h3><hr>
        <p>Like I said, I've come across three of these frames so far. The first one was that of my Uncle's, who purchase it from <a href="">Hall Bicycle</a> in 1974! I was on a cross country road trip to a new job and he offered the frame, wheels, and box of parts to me. Complete with a vintage Brooks Saddle!</p>
        <p>At that point in time I hadn't worked on bikes much, but enjoyed riding them. Over a weekend I cobbled the bike together. After sending a low resolution snapshot to my Uncle he mentioned that the entire frame was actually Chrome. So, I stripped the parts back off and stripped the frame. It was one slick looking ride. Sadly, in a momentary lapse of judgement I sold the bike for a mere penance. Never sell bikes...</p>

        <h3 class='bike'>A Second and Third Chance</h3><hr>
        <p>Back before the advent/popularity of facebook and facebook groups for selling parts I found an original 1972 Raleigh Super Course. It was totally complete! Brooks Saddle, Blumels Fenders,  and Stronglight cottered cranks. When looking I noticed another frame hanging in the gentleman's garage - a 1974 Schwinn Voyaguer II! The seatpost was seized and it was missing wheels. But, it had the original "Schwinn Approved" bar end shifters.</p>
        <p>I wasn't in "need" of either bike but I'm a sucker for vintage rides. The Raleigh with Nervex Lugs, and getting a Voyageur II frame back into my posession was a no brainer. I made the Raleigh "fair weatehr" commuter in the Twin Cities and started going to work V II.</p>

        <p>The following summer I came across another VII frame (again incomplete) at the <a href="">Bike Library</a> fate had brought me two of these frames inside of a year. I snagged up the second frame as a future "thank you" project to my Uncle for his original donation.</p>

        <h3 class='bike'>Classing/Flashing it up</h3><hr>
        <div class="large-5 columns small-12 columns hideme"><p>"...up to that point I eschewed Fat Bikes...until I rode one."</p></div>
        <p>These japanese frames were entirely chromed, then the painted to give the seat and chain stays a chrome look. This process prevents the paint from adhering to the frame - resulting in easy chipping. I spent some time applying stripper to the frame and getting it all back to chrome. I cold set the rear spacing to accomodate the hub spacing of the wheelset I built (36h Ultegra Hubs on Velocity Dyad rims)</p>

        <h3 class='bike'>Shimergo Conversion and adding Bling</h3><hr>
        <p>Campy 10speed shifters are more ergonomic than any SRAM or Shimano brifters, they're also fully rebuildable. When SRAM or Shimano brifters start malfunctioning you have to replace them. The shift tolerances for Campy 10 speed are the same for Shimano 8 speed which makes the perfect match! You get 8 speed drivetrain durability and cost with the ergonics and functionality of nice brifters.</p>
        <p>It's not that I was unhappy with the bar end shifter setup. But I didn't like the amount of cable drag (since I routed cables entirely under the bar wrap for a cleaner look). The Campy shifters keep the same clean look but shorten the housing distance and allow the rider to have full control over brakes and shifting from one hand position.</p>
        <p>I decided to spring for some <a href="">Velo Orange</a> Racks and pedals. This accomplished the following:
          <ol margin-left="10%">
            <li>Adding more chrome to an already super chrome bike.</li>
            <li>Adding cargo capacity for the long tours I will never take this bike on.</li>
            <li>Pedals will allow me to just wear normal street shoes for when I never ride this bike</li>
          </ol>
          A <a href="">PDW Fender Bot</a> light was mounted to the chrome fenders and a smaller 8 speed cluster (12-23 teeth) was added so I could use the super flashy Dura Ace 8 speed derailleur.</p>
        <p>Determining the determing the difference in teeth on the cassette and front chain rings and adding them together. In this case the Dura Ace rear derailleur can accomdate a "capcity" of 29 - I erred on the side of caution and opted for a gear cluster that would for sure would not go beyond the capacity.</p>

    		<h3 class='bike'>Putting it Together</h3><hr>
    		<p>This is a first generation Pugsley with an offset front fork - making the front and rear wheels swappable - a very cool feature. Basically, you get two drive trains. If your rear wheel craps out you can just swap it with the front (provided you have a single speed freewheel on it) and keep on truckin'.</p>
        <p>I'm sure my buddy rode it just a much and just as hard before it came into my possession. Originally I had 9-speed drivetrain in the rear, with a double chain ring up front, and a <a href="http://surlybikes.com/parts/wheels/hubs">Surly Ultra New 135 mm hub</a> on the front wheel. However, the track dropouts on the rear make taking a wheel off a pain if you have a derailleur - which only provided further impetus for converting it to single speed (SS).</p>
        <h5 class="bike">Why Fat?</h5>
        <p>A bit of digression here. I was reluctant and skeptical of fat bikes, and to an extent I still am. They are fun but are only capable of slightly more than most bikes. I've seen good riders tackle difficult terrain on regular 26" mountain bikes or even cyclocross bikes. Essentially, fat bikes make hard terrain easier (and maybe a bit more enjoyable). They're akin to riding a full suspension 10-speed plastic (carbon) bike on Iowa single track trails (totally unnecessary). In actuality riding a fully rigid single speed, MTB makes you a better rider, forcing you to chose lines and use the terrain to your advantage. I was converted to riding rigid SS at <a href="http://www.icorrmtb.org/">Sugar Bottom</a> and started to enjoy riding single track much more. I've become a better rider since switching. So, in this way, I'm 100% against fat bikes. They are also getting to be expensive with all the specialized components.</p>
        <div class="large-5 columns small-12 columns hideme"><p> "I'm still not convinced I need or even want a fat bike. As long as the Pugsley keeps trucking I'll keep riding it - it's the only fat bike I'll ever own."</p></div>
        <p>However, after reading about how the Surly Pugsley was designed (read about it <a href="https://fat-bike.com/2015/05/interview-with-dave-gray-from-surly-bikes/">here</a>) I decided that Pugsley's aren't so bad. Basically, Surly designed a fat bike around widely available parts. 135mm hubs were commonplace a the time (and still are) and 100mm bottom brackets were standard for downhill mountain bikes. That's what I still like about it. Hubs and parts (for the most part) are still fairly inexpensive (except for rims and tyres). Surly has strayed from these design principles (along with the rest of the bike industry). I'm still not convinced I need or even want a fat bike. As long as the Pugsley keeps trucking I'll keep riding it - it's the only fat bike I'll ever own.</p>

        <p>Here are some photos of the bike before and while tearing it down. If viewing on mobile, click on any of the thumbnails for a larger version.</p>

    		<h3 class="bike">Sending the Frame to Powder Coat</h3><hr>
    		<p>I was at a crossroads when faced with this decision. I was at a point where I could try to cobble the bike back together or tear it down and take it in for a new paint job. I called a Chris are RFE to get a quote. $175(ish) for frame and fork sandblast, treatment, and powder coat! Done! Chris at RFE powder coating did one hell of a job blasting and treating this sorry old frame. He discovered "SNOW" was part of the number system on the Bottom Bracket, which is pretty damn cool.</p>
        <p>A quick note on paint vs. powder coat. When you have the option, go with powder coat. It's durable as hell! I chatted with Chris (powder coater) a bit while looking at color/texture options. I wanted to go with a distinct color but also wanted to hide some of the massive pitting that had occurred from all rusting. We both landed on a textured color known as "Blue Steel". If it's Zoolander approved, it's good enough for me!</p>

        <p>We both crossed our fingers that nothing would arise when Chris went to sandblast the frame. There was so much rust that we had both become concerned that he might blast a hole in of the bridges. Luckily, nothing of the sort happened. Chris did a superb job on the coating - breathing new life into a tired frame.</p>
    		<p>Chris has been great to work with. He's reasonable in price, has a quick turn around time, and sent me a library of photos he took from working on the frame</p>

    		<h3 class="bike">Building it Back Up</h3><hr>
        <p>I built it back up a little different. I built a new rear wheel using a Marge Lite Rim, Wheelsmith double butted spokes, and a Surly Ultra New Fixed Disc Hub. That's right, a fixed fat bike! I wanted to strip this down to the simplest possible machine I could. Building a new wheel also freed up a Holy Rolling Darryl for my wife's Pugsley. I used <a href="http://kstoerz.com/freespoke/fullcalc">Free Spoke</a> to figure out spoke lengths and had a friend cut them. The Marge Lite front and Rolling Darryl rear wheel is somewhat like a "Necro" Junior set up. It's a bit lighter and more nimble than the full Necro (which involves a Moonlander Fork).</p>
        <h5 class="bike">Why Fixie?</h5>
        <p>I built up my first fixed gear (fixie) a few years ago. I had a 1972-73 (one of those years) <a href="http://www.jaysmarine.com/1972raleighcat_us_05_lg.jpg">Raleigh Super Course</a> that I had kept in it's original condition, but I wasn't riding it. After converting it to fixed, I discovered how great fixed is when riding in the city. The control that riding fixed gives the rider is great for winter riding - when having control is paramount. So, I figured I'd give the Pugsley the fixed treatment. If for some reason, I don't like it I can easily swap the wheels and ride it as a single speed.</p>
        <div class="large-5 columns small-12 columns hideme"><p> "The tyre combination ended up giving me the same rolling resistance as a square-shaped wheel."</p></div>
        <p>Riding fixed gear is also a great workout. In winter, when most people are starting to fall out of shape due to not riding, my legs will be pumping battery acid from having to push a fat bike around in the cold and windy conditions. The tyre setup and gear ratio will serve as a challenge. I settled on a 2:1 gear ratio - the same as my SS mountain bike. After a bit of riding I discovered that gear ratio might have been a bit ambitious since I'll be pushing a studded front tyre and Surly Nate (huge lugs!) on the rear - giving me about the same rolling resistance as a square-shaped wheel.</p>

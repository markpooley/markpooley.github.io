		<p font-style:"normal">Nic Cage is perhaps America's classiest actor guilty of the most insane frivolous purchases (<a href='http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nic-cage-2009911'>Nic Cage Outbids Leo on T-Rex Skull</a>). He has quite a lengthy film catalog. The challenge is to watch all of Nic Cage's films in a year, hence the term "A Year in the Cage!". A total of 7,724 mins of Nic Cage cinema is to be watched (that's 129 hours of cinema - 2 hrs longer than Aaron Ralston had his arm trapped in a boulder). Said films have had budgets totalling $2,698,853,762 (estimated), and gross revenue of $4,246,829,175 (estimated).</p>
		<p font-style:"normal">After each viewing reactions/thoughts, notable quotes/ "Cagisms" (Great lines from Mr. Cage), Freakouts, Kills, and a "Cage Rating" will be recorded. The "year" will start June 1st, 2015. This is sure to be a truly epic year of watching all 75 Nic Cage Movies (That's an average of one movie every 5 days)!</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: I Wish this was the Prequel to <a data-reveal-id="Trespass">Trespass</a></h3><h6 align="center">If Nic Cage were a food, he'd be a ghost pepper. - Jason or Randy Sklar</h6><hr>
  <p>Originally I was a bit distraught after removing the DVD from the case. This was one of those "double sided" discs where one side is full screen and other was widescreen. The reason for my distress is one side was scratched to sh*t with the label "widescreen" - so I thought I'd have to watch this in full screen. Thankfully the label on one side corresponds to the aspect ratio on the other and I was able to watch this in widescreen. Library patrons do not respect the CAGE!</p>
  <p>This was the first time <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001708/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Joel Schumacher</a> and Cage worked together. I wanted this to be the prequel to <a data-reveal-id="Trespass">Trespass</a> (where Schumacher and Caged worked together as well), and maybe it is (once again making Tim's proof true, which can be viewed from the <a data-reveal-id="GhostRider2">Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance</a> review). Maybe <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001416/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Catherine Keener</a> (Cage's wife) left him after his harrowing investigation of the snuff film - taking their daughter with her. Cage gave up his life as a P.I. and moved into the diamond trade - eventually marrying Kidman with whom he'd have another daughter. Those breaking into his house were actually associates of those he killed back during his days as P.I. investigating the snuff film.</p>
  <p>Cage plays a private investigator who may have gotten his "big break" when asked by a recently widowed millionaire to determine the authenticity of a snuff film found in her recently deceased husband's belongings. Cage takes the case and drives off to Cleveland (Where Terminal Tower soars up in the sky, over 50 groovy stories high) to scour the missing persons database/resource center.
  <iframe id="iFrame" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/35542391" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>This is where we leave reality, and enter Cage reality for a bit. Let's do some math.</p>
  <ul id='pList'>
    <li>850,000 - 1,000,000 persons go missing each year (according to director of the center).</li>
    <li>We'll assume for the year Cage was looking 850,000 went missing. He has to look at every photo in the database and compare it to that of the girl in the film. Assuming it takes 5 seconds to do a cursory visual comparison that's:
      <ul>
      <li>850,000 * 5 sec / 60 sec = 70,833 minutes</li>
      <li>70,833 minutes = 1,180 hours </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>working 16 hr days straight, 7 days a week that would require 74 days to troll the entire record set. If we assume that half are men, that still requires 37 days of looking (worst case scenario). Cage finds the girl after a few days (week tops) - lucky Cage!</li>
</ul>
  <p>Cage's tenacity pays off leading him down a meandering trail requiring him to cross the continent and befriend Max California (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Joaquin Phoenix</a> or as I pronounce it JO-kin PA-hone-ix) who I'm still convinced is related to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0293798/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_6">Robert California</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/?ref_=nv_sr_1">The Office</a>. Max is an aspiring Musician in LA that works at a porn store to pay the bills but feeds his mind high brow literature like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood">In Cold Blood</a>. Cage trolls through LA's non-existent red-light district looking for clues - basically an excuse for Cage to see a bunch of topless women.</p>
  <p>Cage enlists the help of Max and his midriff to track down the "seedier" establishments of the underground porn industry - eventually leading them to "The Russian/Nihilist" (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001780/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Peter Stormare</a>) director/creator of the film Cage is investigating. Cage get's the bottom of the story fast - narrowly escaping death from the Nihilist. Sadly Midriff Max meets his demise from the same S&amp;M guy who killed the girl in the film.</p>
  <p>Cage goes rogue when he obtains permission from the girl's mother to kill those responsible for her death. A solid Cage performance that would have been made better by cutting a good 30 minutes from the runtime, adding a few more freakouts, and possibly at least one more death-by-crossbow. Maybe they did that for the sequel <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448172/?ref_=nv_sr_1">8mm 2</a> (yep, they made a sequel).</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Much Denim. Such wow.</h3>
  <h6 align="center">A classic game of cat and mouse (caution, there's spoilers).</h6><hr>
  <p>An overly dramatic, denim-clad Cage plays a homeless drifter looking for work. As part of his morning routine, he wakes from sleeping in his car and does shirtless one-handed push-ups on empty Wyoming highways. He was promised a job on an oil rig but didn't get it when he was honest about having a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="This becomes an issue more than once in the movie">bum knee</span>.</p>
  <p>The honesty of Cage's character becomes more apparent when he doesn't rob a gas station when filling up for gas - what a classy guy! He does make sure to give dramatic pause when responding to the attendants request for payment. When Cage rolls into Red Rock, WY the classic case of mistaken identity leads Cage to take a job as a hitman to kill a bar owner's wife.</p>
  <p>Cage's business prowess is impeccable, as is his ability to play a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="He keeps a handgun in his glove box.">Texan</span>. He pits the husband and wife against one another (wife = Lara Flynn Boyle), where the wife offers twice what the husband is paying. With a fresh $15,000 in his pocket Cage (smartly) decides to split town - only to return when he <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I really think it was the victim's fault since he ran out onto the highway in the middle of the night in the pouring rain.">accidentally nails some dude</span> on the highway. Classic, classy Cage returns to Red Rock in order to get the victim to the emergency room, which apparently exists in a town of 1,500.</p>
  <p>This turns into a pivotal point, as we learn that the guy that hired Cage is actually the sheriff! Cage narrowly escapes a contrived scenario when the sheriff gives him the key to handcuffs. Cage is able to escape due to the generosity of a fellow marine, who happens to be Lyle - the actual hitman hired by the Sheriff. Another feline enters the game of "cat and mouse"!</p>
  <p>Cage is able to take down Lyle and help Boyle escape by taking the classic Middle Eastern approach of throwing a shoe at an old white dude. Cage (proving he does <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Read the 'Drive Angry: Shot in 3D' review">know a thing or two about engines</span>) disables Lyle's car so he and a cross-dressing "Indiana Jones" Boyle can escape and eventually take a trip to the bonezone.</p>
  <p>We eventually learn that Sherrif and Tranny Indiana Jones (Boyle) are thieves on the run from a job in Illinois.  A climactic graveyard scene ensues where the Sheriff gets a knife to the neck and Lyle is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I'm counting this as a kill since Lyle would not have survived this injury, even though Boyle shot him dead later">impaled on a gravestone</span> by Cage.</p>
  <p>I was utterly confused at the logic here. Why would the sheriff bury $500,000 in a graveyard? What if he needed it? Why wouldn't you hide it somewhere just a bit more convenient?</p>
  <p>Cage escapes by hopping a train, bum knee and all. Indy/Boyle temporarily escapes on the same train. But, when she tries to shoot Cage he's chill since he knows the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="There's absolutely no way he could have known this, except for being clairvoyant like in 'Next'">gun doesn't have bullets</span>. Cage calmly dumps out the money. Indy/Boyle jumps out after it. Cage snags a wayward stack of "benjamins" caught in the door and chills hard while the train takes him away.</p>
  <div class="panel">Erin accompanied me in the viewing of this Cage classic. As usual, she dozed off midway through. But, everytime Cage freaked out she would wake for just a bit and state "freakout" before returning to her slumber</div>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Flaming Demons wear eye-liner during the day.</h3><h6 align="center">Can a sequel be better than the first terrible installment? <a data-reveal-id="ShittyProof">Maybe...</a></h6><hr>
  <p>It's been quite a while since I've seen the "original" Ghost Rider. Thankfully, the makers of this sequel assumed the audience had no working knowledge of the story line and brought the viewer up to speed with some pretty good animation and voice over by Cage himself. One element that seemed a bit odd was the Devil having people actually sign paperwork. You'd think the Devil would have a slightly better option than merely signing documents that resembled shitty employment contract for a chain restaurant.</p>
  <p>The movie opens with a solid chase scene starring <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I'm still curious how the hell he ended up in this movie.">Idris Elba</span>. Soon, Cage appears and I'm fairly certain he's wearing eyeliner. Idris' character survived driving off a precipitous cliff by landing in a tree, and magically avoiding impalement. Cage is also apparently scared of light (but only for the first few minutes).</p>
  <p>In no time, we see "The Rider" - but never actually see a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="probably due to the effects budget being limited">full transition</span>. Cage is always trying to keep the demon at bay, which makes for some truly awesome freakout scenes (nothing as epic as "The Wickerman", but still solid freakouts). Eventually, the plot becomes evident. The Devil (character name Roarke) needs a new body and this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="who is of course the son of a pretty young lady">kid</span> is the body the Devil is aiming to take on.</p>
  <p>We learn all this, then get another animated voiceover with Cage explaining why the Devil needs to take on different human forms (presumably to arc the character previously played by Peter Fonda?) ending with the face of Jerry Springer - which was a truly awesome touch.</p>
  <p>After "The Rider" kills an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I estimated around 30">undetermined amount of people</span> using a giant strip-mining digging machine the Devil possess/reanimates the lead pursuant of Cage and company into a demon that causes everything to decay that he touches. This allowed for a rather clever stab at Twinkies, in that the only food this character eats is Twinkies (because nothing natural is in them).</p>
  <p>Christopher Lambert shows up as a bald headed tattooed priest (in his first major role since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144964/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_38">Highlander: Endgame</a>). An epic battle ensues where "The Rider" kills another undetermined amount of people and Cage/Blaze realize the demon that possess him is actually a fallen angel looking to do good in the world.</p>
  <p>Oh, and there's a quick cutscene of "The Rider" pissing fire - awesome!</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Cage's Salad Days</h3><h6 align="center">I don't know cuss words from Shinola either. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I looked it up, it's a brand of boot polish that is a euphemism for sh*t">WTF is Shinola</span></h6><hr>
  <p>A roll so iconic it inspired Serbians to insert (poorly) Cage's nuclear family onto a textbook cover! <img align="right" src="images/arizona_text.jpg"> Cage is a career petty criminal that can't help but rob convenience stores. Of course, Cage has a Southern Accent - his self-declared forte of accents. Cage promises to reform and become a civilized and law-abiding citizen. His first step is marrying poor Ed who's fiance (she pronounced it FEE-ance) left her and they enjoy the "Salad Days" of their marriage.</p>
  <p>Sadly, the sun sets on Cage's "salad days" when they discover Ed is barren. These two baby hungry newlyweds turn back to Cage's life of crime to steal one of the recently born "Arizona Quintuplets", reasoning that "they don't need that many!".</p>
  <p>Cage has some trepidation toward fatherhood, perhaps best expressed in their photo that night.The night of the baby-napping Cage is haunted by a dirty <a data-reveal-id="GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a> bounty hunter (an unintentional foreshadowing of Cage's future role...?). As if Cage's life couldn't become more troublesome Evelle and Gale show up after Gale (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">John Goodman</a>) escapes prison by birthing himself from a mud hole. Glen and Evelle make themselves scarce when Cage's Boss, Glen shows up with his wife (Dot) and 5 hellish children.  Glen propositions Cage into swinging, to which Cage has an unfavorable response. Cage is fired from Hudsucker Industries as a consequence, the company that would later be featured in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110074/?ref_=tt_rec_tti">The Hudsucker Proxy</a></p>
  <p>Cage's doubts regarding fatherhood come to a front when he decides to leave Ed and their recently acquired baby. But his efforts are stymied by Gale and Evelle when they learn the child has a $25,000 reward - causing truly classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001053/?ref_=tt_ov_wr">Coen Brothers</a> right scene to unfold - a scene where we learn the dangers of textured popcorn ceilings (which I loathe) when Cage scrapes his knuckles on the ceiling and cries out in pain.</p>
  <p>A climactic chase ensues where Gale and Evelle keep leaving baby Arizona on the side of the road, and the dirty Ghost Rider Bounty Hunter tracks them down. The chase comes to a front when Cage meets dirty Ghost Rider and ultimately kills him by pulling a pin from one of the grenades attached to one of his bandoliers - creating a rather epic Cage Kill! The Rider had it coming since he threw grenades at innocent bunnies and shot cute little lizards earlier</p>
  <p>Ed and Cage's conscience get the best of them and they return the baby. The Coen Brothers should be credited with giving Cage a massive bump in celebrity. Unfortunately, Cage found it difficult to work with the Coens, basically stating his hair was one of the very few creative choices he was allowed to make (paraphrased from an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lipton">James Lipton</a> from <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/inside-the-actors-studio">Inside the Actors Studio).</a></p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Does it count as a kill if Cage tells someone else where to shoot?</h3>
  <h6 align="center">Based on the Philip K. Dick Novel, only not.</h6><hr>
   <p>Apparently this move was/is based on the Philip K. Dick Story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Man">The Golden Man</a>. A story about a post-apocalyptic future in where mutants exist and are hunted by humans (basically X-Men). But one mutant can't be killed due to his ability to see into the future. From what I can surmise, that is the only thing this movie shares with the book on which it is ostensibly based. More likely, Nic Cage just liked the title because it had "Gold" in it. In this "adaptation" Nic Cage plays <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="this is his stage name, because Cadillac's are classy">Frank Cadillac</span>, a washed up magician in Las Vegas. His act hardly pays the bills so he gambles for supplemental income. In the first few minutes, Frank/Cage pulls in a cool $9,000 from blackjack. But, while trying to cash in his chips he prevents a robbery/double murder. Unfortunately, Frank/Cage is caught with the gun he just disarmed from the perp. He evades security using his future seeing ability, hops into a Dodge Charger (not quite Eleanor) and a chase scene ensues. This sequence involves terrible CGI and Cage obviously in a studio with a green screen. The special effects in this sequence are on par with a driving scene from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053479/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_59">The Andy Griffith Show</a>.</p>
  <p>Frank/Cage uses his ability to see 2 minutes into the future in his "magic" act. Which, you'd think would draw more attention since it actually seems quite magical. Alas, he plays to a small crowd of elderly people and middle-income vacationers - except Julianne Moore. Moore is an FBI agent hell-bent on partnering with Frank because he can see into the future. She's trying to get Frank to be like the "pre-cogs" in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/"><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Also based on a Philip K. Dick Novel, only it actually was (click for IMDB page)">Minority Report</span></a>. The problem is Frank's hair can't be caged, so his character obviously can't. Another quandary is why isn't he stuck in an infinite loop. If he can see into the future, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="refer to the epic quote below">that changes everything</span>, which in turn changes the future, he should be stuck in an infinite loop.</p>
  <p>Frank is enamored by this one girl he keeps seeing in the future because her presence allowed him to see far beyond 2 minutes. The girl is Jessica Biel's character, who is nearly 20 years Cage's Junior! After the car chase scene and Frank/Cage evading Julianne Moore's character through future seeing it becomes apparent just how bonkers this movie is because it keeps going, then (spoiler!) rewinds to inform you that it was just Frank/Cage/ future seeing.</p>
  <p>Cage finally connects with Biel's Character after future-seeing a series of botched encounters with her. All the smooth lines he uses in potential encounters are shot down, so he does the manly thing and takes a punch from her d-bag boy toy - Kendall. This move gets his foot in the door and major sympathy points from Biel. So, he cashes in those points by asking her for a ride to Flagstaff, AZ.  Of course, she obliges since he's dreamy and has already won her over. You endure a litany of cheesy lines Cage uses to impress/swoon Biel. Eventually, she falls for him. But, he pauses, closes his eyes the following exchange happens:</p>
  <p>"Wow, that was incredible" <i>Cage</i><br>"What was?" <i>Biel</i><br>"This" (they kiss, then take a trip to the bonezone)</p>
  <p>We learn that Moore is after Cage to help her track down a stolen nuke that they think will be detonated in LA.  Because Moore is after Cage, so are the terrorists. Which makes little sense - but so does this entire movie. Frank/Cage "Matrixes"/dodge's bullets at least twice. Unfortunately, Cage's conscious get's the best of him and he acquiesces to Moore's pleas for help. The next scene is straight out of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/">A Clockwork Orange</a> with Frank/Cage in front of a TV with his eyes held open by some strange apparatus. Cage mildly freaks out (the only time in the entire movie) and starts helping Moore. She then turns over the entire operation to him. Next, a shit-ton of Federal Agents descend on the terrorist stronghold with Frank/Cage walking around like a boss - telling agents where to go, where to shoot, and when.</p>
  <p> They search the ship. Cage takes all the floors, leaving only one to the agents, one of whom is shot dead. Why couldn't Cage have just searched the entire damn ship and saved a life? In the last standoff Cage and Moore encounter the terrorist holding <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Oh yeah, Biel was being held hostage for about half the movie">Biel hostage</span>. The terrorist shoots at Cage while he Matrixes the shit out of him and Moore shoots the terrorist in the head. Cage looks onto a screen playing a newsreel (I guess this how he sees the future) and sees that he wasn't able to save LA from the nuclear blast. But with 10 mins left in the movie, we learn that well over half of it had been future-seeing. It cuts back to Cage in bed with Biel. Oh yes, because she amplifies his power he was able to see all of this!  He calls Moore, tells her he'll cooperate. Then, after an epic morning in the Bonezone Cage just tells Biel that he has to leave for an important job, but that "he'll find her. It may be a week, it may be a month. But he will find her". Why not just get a damn phone number!?! Cage is calm as a Hindu Cow and slides off to presumably save LA.  The credits Roll Backward from top to bottom - trippy.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: I still don't know the significance of the title</h3> <h6 align="center">Amputee Cage wins the heart of his brother's fiance&eacute;</h6><hr>
  <p>I watched this after watching <a data-reval-id="LeavingLasVegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a>, so my faith in Cage had deteriorated a bit. Luckily Moonstruck opens with Sinatra's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suWWlFQah2M">"Amore"</a> and turned out to be pretty well done. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001156/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Olympia Dukakis</a> <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Surprisingly, Cher won for her leading role in this movie, and it won for Best Writing. It was nominated for Best Picture as well. Sadly, Cage was not nominated.">won an Oscar</span>  for her supporting role married to Cher's copper-obsessed unfaithful plumber father. So I guess this and the previous viewing can be considered a run of Cage's "Oscar-winning films" - both of them.</p>
  <p>A <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="She believes lack of following tradition was the reason for her first husband getting hit by a bus. Yep, that's it. It was a curse, not a freak accident.">widowed Cher</span> becomes engaged to Johnny but demands he have a ring and get down on one knee for his proposal. Johnny only has a pinky ring and is worried about ruining his suit when kneeling (other restaurant patrons are worried for his suit too). Johnny has to fly to Italy in order to tend to his dying mother. A brief dialog is exchanged about curses - which turns out is an important plot point, one I still don't fully comprehend.</p>
  <p>Johnny calls Cher from Italy asking her to call his brother about their engagement announcement. Cher asks as though this is equivalent to the burden of Atlas. She caves and calls his brother - who turns out to be Cage! Finally, a dreadfully absent Cage shows up nearly 30-minutes in.</p>
  <p>Cage's character, Ronny (which made me think of <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/113207">Shy Ronnie</a>) is an amputee baker. Which despite it being 1987 he still wears a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="This seems like the least appropriate prosthetic for a baker shoveling coal into bread ovens.">wooden prosthetic hand</span>. Cage freaks out that Cher is marrying his brother because he blames his brother for the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="He claims his fiance&eacute; at the time left him after he lost his hand. So his brother is responsible for that misfortune as well.">loss of his hand</span>. Ronny firmly believes it's his brother's fault for distracting him while he was cutting meat. Now his two-handed brother is engaged - only creating further turmoil between them. Cage exclaims that Cher could lose her head married to his idiot brother, flips the kitchen table, and they take a trip to the bonezone.</p>
  <p>Naturally the Cher-Ronny hookup occurs during a bright full moon which is supposed to responsible (in part anyway) for Cage falling in  love with Cher after their hookup. Cher freaks out. Cage demands they attend the opera together stating, "If I can have the night with the thing I love (opera) and the woman I love I'll stop bothering you." At said opera, Cher runs into her father with his mistress. Cher spends the night at Cage's and her fiance&eacute;, Johnny, returns to an absent Cher. </p>
  <p>The following morning they all gather in Cher's kitchen for oatmeal. Johnny calls off the engagement - believing the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Seems a bit bold, but it works out well for Cher.">marriage would result in the death of his mother</span>. A bold Cage asks for his brother's ring and proposes to Cher. They all drink Champagne with Alka-Seltzer even <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Why on earth is he still hanging out there?">Johnny</span>.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: What was the Academy Thinking?</h3><h6 align="center">Seriously, this got him an Oscar? <a data-reveal-id="Outcast">Outcast</a> was better acted than this.</h6><hr>
  <p>I honestly can't believe this was Cage's Oscar-winning performance. What the hell? I had high expectations that were unilaterally unmet. The movie opens to a drunk Cage asking <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507659/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Richard Lewis</a> for money, boldly driving and drinking from an open liquor container while a cop passes him and chugging whiskey in a strip club. All this happens for a solid 10 mins then the opening credits start.</p>
  <p>Cage is fired from his job as a screenwriter and decides to throw out or burn all his flaming worldly possessions, but elects to leave a sweet <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Why on earth is there a BMX bike in his house? He's obviously not hitting the skate parks in his spare time...">BMX bike</span> untouched in his house and head to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. Throughout the exposition and what turns out to be the entire f*cking movie, there's either a saxophone playing smooth/sad jazz or a piano playing a similar mood of music - often <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which is largely uneventful and unimportant anyway">overpowering the dialogue</span>.</p>
  <p>Vegas is where he meets <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Yep. That's spelled correctly. It's as 'creative' as the spelling of Terry in Zandalee">Sera</span> (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000223/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Elisabeth Shue</a>) and desperately propositions her - taking her back to his $29/night hotel room (equivalent to $45/night in 2015) and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Resulting in one of the few quotable moments of the movie">starts singing</span> while she performs oral sex on him. They both fall asleep.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396812/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t26">Danny Huston</a> shows up briefly as "Bartender #2" (which is only noteworthy due to him being in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455538/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31">How to Loose Friends & Alienate People</a> in which <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Simon Pegg</a> proclaims <a data-reveal-id="ConAir">Con Air</a> to be the greatest movie ever). Sera is scouring the city looking for Cage. I guess it doesn't occur to her to just camp out at his dilapidated hotel room. At this point cut scenes are thrown in where it appears as though Sera is talking with a therapist or something - recounting her experience with Cage. I think this was added in post production in an attempt to provide some narrative and context for the viewer. Without these cut scenes, the movie would have made even less sense.</p>
  <p>Sera asks Cage to move in with her because she's lonely and needs a place to hang his hat while continuing on his booze-fueled downward spiral to death. Sera gives Cage a flask - further enabling his habit. Cage get's the shakes one evening climbs into Sera's bed to be the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Admit it or not, everbody likes to be the little spoon. It makes them feel safe. - Andy Samberg">little spoon</span>.</p>
  <p>This movie just continues on a series of disjointed scenes where Sera is attempting to work as a prostitute, Cage is getting drunk, or the two are hanging out. At one point, Cage gets headbutted in a bar only to show up at Sera's all bloody where she wastes no time making out with a bloody-faced Cage. I honestly think this was just a license for Cage to just be crazy and dress in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Poofy shirts, pleated pants, and occasionally a vest.">mid 90's appropriate attire</span>.</p>
  <p>Eventually Sera pleas for Cage to stop drinking. To which, he responds by eating ice cubes with chopsticks and later bedding down with a different prostitute in a hotel room (Sera walks in on him). I was continually wondering what the point of this movie was and kept hoping for it be over long before it was. I can't believe Cage followed up this unremarkable performance with his best (by my estimation) role <a data-reveal-id="TheRock">The Rock</a>.</p>

 <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: FTD is a License for Craziness</h3><h6 align="center">Wait...is this...Yeah, I think this is actually good?</h6><hr>
  <p>Essentially Cage is a CIA/Secret agent that was tortured by some terrorist in the Middle East. Said terrorist was thought to have been killed during Cage's extraction. But for 22 years Cage hasn't believed it. During the torture sequence Banir (the terrorist) cut's Cage's right ear in a very similar way to how animal shelters clip the ears of strays to indicate they have been neutered - maybe some other parts of Cage were clipped to?</p>
  <p>Cut to present day where <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947338/?ref_=nv_sr_1"> Anton Yelchin/Checkov</a> is a desk jockey as the same agency as Cage. Chekov is itchy to get out in the field and sees Cage's obsession with the long thought dead terrorist as his avenue to do just that. Chekov puts together that Banir is still alive from a doctor supplying drugs to a supposed Nigerian in Romania (location is responsible for a great quote. Read below)</p>
  <p>The two head to Romania on an unsanctioned trip. Cage's <a href="http://www.alz.org/dementia/fronto-temporal-dementia-ftd-symptoms.asp">FTD</a> (Frontotemporal Dementia) causes him to wear an incredibly obnoxious hat and wander around Bucharest spouting random numbers. He also gets the shakes from time to time, which are a mixture of his withdrawal scenes from <a data-reveal-id="LeavingLasVegas" >Leaving Las Vegas</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo9K3Hdv_R8">Ash's hand turning evil in Evil Dead</a>.</p>
  <p>They connect with the doctor and Cage poses as him to meet Banir in Mombasa (another fantastic related quote below). Cage pulls of a mostly believable Romanian accent (certainly better than that of <a data-reveal-id="Outcast">Outcast</a> but not as good as <a data-reveal-id="ConAir">Con Air</a>). Cage doesn't kill Banir at first. But, when Banir's goons open fire at a hotel pool Cage goes crazy and takes out Banir in what has to be one of the most epic kill scenes ever filmed to date. Without any weapon, Cage graphically eye gouges Banir to death using his index finger. While driving back to his hotel in Mombasa, a content Cage calmly turns his van into oncoming traffic on the highway in what we are to assume is his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Again. I ask, does it count as a 'Cage Kill' if he kills himself?">death</span>.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Physics = Wizardy</h3><h6 align="center">The only movie about wizards/sorceres involving a car chase.</h6><hr>
  <p>According to IMDB, the idea for this movie was largely that of Cage's, as he wanted to "explore a mystical world with a magical character".  So naturally, they adapted an old Disney Animated Short (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032455/">Fantasia</a>) and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Basically adding explosions, action scenes, and mildly witty dialogue">"Bruckheimered"</span> it by adding explosions and a car chase. This basically provided a premise for Cage to wave his hands around mysteriously and wear a sweet leather trench coat. The Production also leveled a small forest to produce the requisite 1000 lbs of confetti for the Chinatown sequence.</p>
  <p>Cage plays an apprentice of Merlin, who is caught in a pseudo "love triangle" with the other two apprentices - three apprentices seems like a lot, but then again this is Merlin.  An evil sorceress shows up and Cage traps his love interest and her in a Russian babushka doll. Cage is stuck in an ageless state wandering the world looking for some child prophet that will grow to be as powerful as Merlin was. That's how the story ends up in the year 2000, then 2010.</p>
  <p>Per a conversation in the "one of a kind" Rolls Royce Phantom (Cage's own car he offered up for shooting) sorcerers are basically <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219289/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Limitless</a>  - using 100% of their brain (humans only using 10% of their brain is a common misconception).</p>
  <p>Cage's apprentice Dave (played by Jay Baruchel) learns a bit of magic and employs it to clean his secret laboratory, paying homage to the original fantasia, as well as a scene from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057546/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The Sword and the Stone</a>. Neither of these is technically a "rip-off" since the "inspiration" material is also Disney's.</p>
  <p>When not driving his snap start Rolls, Cage flys around the city on a metal gargoyle eagle turning wolves into puppies, and picking up the Meryl Lynch Bull. Dave/Jay employs the use of physics to defeat the nebulous foe by outfitting the Rolls with a button actuated Tesla Coil (Dave's specialty and reason for having a secret lab).</p>
  <p>Cage appeared to care a bit for this one - offering up a decent performance that was mostly entertaining. It's no classic by any means. But, as far as "kid's movies" go (I assume that was the intended audience), this is far more entertaining than some of the garbage Hollywood produces for the under 10 crowd. </p>
  <p>The moral of this classic Disney Tale adaptation is: stay in school, get the girl, learn magic, save the f*cking day.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: This Get's Meta!</h3><h6 align="center">You are what you love. Not what loves you  - <i>Charlie Kaufman/Cage</i></h6><hr>
  <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/">"Adaptation"</a> was nominated for four academy awards with Cage receiving a nomination for Best Actor. Sadly, he was up against <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253474/">Adrien Brody</a> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004778/">The Pianist</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000358/">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/">Gangs of New York</a>, so he didn't really have much of a chance. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177933/">Chris Cooper</a> picked up the best supporting role though, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000658/">Meryl Streep</a> was also nominated.</p>
  <p>Nic Cage deviates from his roles as a <a data-reveal-id="TheFamilyMan">sexed opera enthusiast</a>, <a data-reveal-id="Moonstruck">amputee baker</a>, <a data-reveal-id="GhostRider2">Flaming Demon</a>, and <a data-reveal-id="RedRockWest">Sexy Demin Drifter</a> to play perhaps his least attractive role as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442109/?ref_=tt_ov_wr">Charlie Kaufman</a> (who is a real Hollywood screenwriter). What's more, Charlie/Cage has an equally unattractive identical twin (his brother <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0178898/">Marc Coppola</a> often served as a stand-in for his twin).  This movie might be worth watching for the sheer amount of time Cage is on screen - often Cage x 2! There's even a point where we see Cage playing Donald who is acting as Charlie - whoa! That's about as trippy as Cage as Travolta playing Cage in <a data-reveal-id="FaceOff">Face/Off</a>.</p>
  <p>Essentially, this is a meta-movie in that it's about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442109/?ref_=tt_ov_wr">Charlie Kaufman's</a> struggling journey in adapting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orchid_Thief">The Orchid Thief</a> for a the big screen and how he ultimately writes the adaptation about his struggles with the adaptation of the book. Has your brain exploded yet?</p>
  <p>Cage is incredibly awkward (not his smooth and suave self from <a data-reveal-id="Next">Next</a>). He frequently dreams of sexual encounters with women in his life that he doesn't have the balls to ask out on a proper date. Meanwhile Donald Kaufman, Charlie's Twin (also played by Cage and the only fictional person to ever receive an oscar nomination) hits it off with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350454/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t23">Maggie Gyllenhaal</a> and has a budding career as a screenwriter.</p>
  <p>Charlie travels to NY to meet with Streep's character (the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orchid_Thief">"The Orchid Thief"</a>) but ends up spying on her in a creepy voyeuristic way - going so far as to follow her to Florida where she has a scandalous romantic rendezvous with Cooper's character (who is missing his front teeth BTW) and rips fat rails of an orchid derived drug. Streep does fat lines of the fine Floridian Flake multiple times in order to feel passionate about "something". </p>
  <p>Both Charlie and Donald followed Streep's character to Florida. Charlie get's caught pulling a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Peeping+Tom&utm_source=search-action">"peeping tom"</a>. Streep is tripping balls on Orchid and surmises that the only solution to the scenario is killing Charlie. They take him to the swamp where Cooper hunts for orchids with the intent of killing him and leaving his body for the alligators.</p>
  <p>In a classic cage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina">Dues ex Machina</a>, Charlie is saved by his brother hiding in the back seat. They fall asleep behind a log and wait until morning. When walking out Donald is shot by Cooper. Charlie and Donald speed off in their Ford Taurus only to get into a nasty collision with a park ranger that results in Donald flying through the windshield and dying (Always wear your seatbelt folks - they save lives). Charlie runs into the swamp again where another case of the <i>Dues ex Machina</i> plot device plays out in the form of Cooper being killed by an alligator. </p>
  <p>Charlie finally rubs some <a href="https://www.androgel.com/">AndroGel</a> on his nonexistent coin purse and asks out his original love interest.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Good Call Baby Doll!</h3><h6 align="center">Never leave your gay taser cartridge at a crime scene - Hit Girl (paraphrased)</h6><hr>
  <p>In a world where <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_spirit/">The Spirit</a> was so successful they turned it into a trilogy comes the story of a loner high school student and a father-daughter duo coming together to take down the local drug kingpin. Cage nonchalantly described the experience of being shot to his daughter while she's wearing a flak jacket preparing to be shot by her Cage. Meanwhile, A-aron Johnson gets stabbed and hit by a car while trying to live out his fantasy of becoming a superhero. This incident leaves his nervous system damaged to the point where he can no longer feel pain.</p>
  <p>Cage, funded by a seemingly endless stream of cash from assets seized during drug busts (done by him and Hit Girl) holes up in a tiny apartment filled to the brim with guns and assorted weapons. Cage "borrows" heavily from <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Except &quot;Big Daddy&quot; seems to enjoy killing people, unlike Batman...">Batman's suit</span> for his superhero alter ego - "Big Daddy". Cage spends his spare time drawing detailed comic artwork of the McLovin's dad who is a drug kingpin.</p>
  <p>Cage is simply a well-meaning father who fully owns the "Dad" look, complete with dated attire, out of style haircut and glasses, but one hell of an epic mustache and dry sense of humor. The feature hero, Kick-Ass, has to be bailed out of a scenario by Hit Girk - Cage's daughter. A partnership is forged and Kick-Ass measures his success not by criminals stopped or people saved, but by followers/fans on MySpace! If not for the mention of MySpace this movie wouldn't seem so dated.</p>
  <p>Kick-Ass and Big Daddy get double crossed by McLovin and Cage has a truly epic freakout while he's burning alive (understandable). Cage is burned to the point where his lips are burned off and he has to speak like a ventriloquist to utter his dying words to his daughter - Hit Girl. Hit Girl then goes on an epic killing spree - similar to that of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000147/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Colin Firth</a> in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802144/">The Kingsman</a> (If you haven't watched it yet, drop what you're doing and watch it. Firth is amazing!).</p>
  <iframe id="iFrame"  align="middle" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2JfjO1PZxXc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe
  <p>Kick-Ass saves the f*ckin' day by showing up on a jetpack with dual Gatling guns then using an RPG launcher to blow McLovin's father through a plate glass window and into the city skyline where he is "disappeared" (reference to <a data-reveal-id="Stolen">Stolen</a>) by the fired RPG in a fantastic explosion. McLovin's father totally deserved it for having his henchmen microwave a guy earlier (great scene BTW)</p>
  <p>If Cage had a more prominent role in this it would be classic in the Cage Cannon. It's got over the top violence and gore, copious profanity and offensive language, and a barely believable plot. </p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Never disrobe before a gunfight</h3>
  <h6 align="center">This is what a schizophrenic mind projected onto film looks like - <i>Tom</i></h6>
  <hr>
  <p>Orginally the story was written about a 70-year-old. But, when Cage expressed interest producers jettisoned that notion and altered the story so the age of the main character (John Milton) was irrelevant. In an interview, Cage stated he expressed interest precisely because of the sequence wherein John Milton gets his eye shot out. Apparently there was a similar scene in <a data-reveal-id="SeasonOfTheWitch">"Season of the Witch"</a>, but it was cut to maintain a PG-13 rating.</p>
  <p>Also, "Drive Angry" is a misnomer. Cage is a little confused and slightly irritated throughout the entire film, sometimes just "out to lunch" - definitely not angry. Maybe he became angry after it set the record for the lowest opening weekend of a 3D movie - ever!</p>
  <p>The summary on IMDB is a bit incorrect. This movie is about a father who escapes from hell in a muscle car to track down the dickless devil worshiping cult leader that killed his daughter and kidnaped his granddaughter. There's an attractive female supporting lead just for kicks and giggles.</p>
  <p>Opening credits/exposition is mainly low-budget CGI with some narration by William Fichtner wherein we see <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="a feat that is hardly ever mentioned throughout the film">John Milton escaping hell in some sort of muscle car</span>. The utter insane nature of this film becomes apparent during the opening chase scene which involves a Ford 150 flipping over a stopped Buick Regal with all three passengers of the truck remaining conscious. The blatant disregard of fundamental physics is but one of many oversights.There's obvious pandering to the 3D in the opening sequence, but it's abandoned until the final scene. So the movie should be "Drive Somewhat Annoyed: in 3D (but just for a bit). It's almost as if the filmmakers forgot that it was in 3D until the very end scene and were like "Oh, Sh*t, we need to add some more 3D stuff!"</p>
  <p>Piper, played by Amber Heard, is talking with her coworker (April from <a href="http://www.hbo.com/eastbound-and-down">"East Bound and Down"</a>) about her loser, unemployed boyfriend she coerced into proposing to her by withholding sex. Pro-tip: if you have to convince anyone to marry you, let alone by withholding sexual activities, maybe they aren't the best life partner. The manager of the restaurant gets upset at Piper, so she grabs his cojones in full view of the patrons, quits and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="impressively, she manages a full wardrobe change whilst walking out">walks out</span>. This is actually an important part, in that her quitting allows her to go on the impromptu road trip with Milton/Cage.</p>
  <p>Prior to this, Cage briefly makes out with April/Katy Mixon but tosses her aside when she botches his coffee order by forgetting the sugar (which is on his table). We next see Piper driving her sweet Dodge Charger down the road singing along with the track that I assume is named <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="always a wise choice for pain mitigation">"F*ck the Pain Away"</span>.  Piper's car breaks down, but luckily Cage is in the woods nearby and shows up to help her out. He gives something in the engine compartment a quarter turn and they're back on the road. That's right, Piper isn't the least bit creeped out by the sudden appearance of Cage, but actually agrees to give this creepy dude with highlighted hair plugs a ride!</p>
  <p>When Piper walks in on her winner of a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="not quite Stone Cold Steve Austin, who actually a producer on the film">boyfriend</span> in the bonezone with some other woman she freaks out! Honestly, what did she expect would happen when withholding sex from a horny not quite Stone Cold Steve Austin? Of course, this scene involved nudity at only 14 minutes, which is 1 minute sooner than "Valley Girl". Piper drags "not quite Stone Cold's" new lover outside and knocks her out.</p>
  <p>Eventually, we're introduced the villain, Jonah King, through a flashback. King kidnaps a baby from Milton/Cage's daughter and forces her to perform oral sex. She bites his wang off and stabs him with his pentagram(ish) pendant. King responds by slicing her throat then face waterfalling himself with her <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="and likely some his?">blood</span>.</p>
  <p>Shortly after the flashback, the two roll into the family-friendly restaurant/motel named "Bull by the Balls". Piper eyes the biggest pudge in the place to take back to her room where he's fully nude painting her toenails. Meanwhile, Cage is loudly in the bonezone with Candy, their waitress from the previous scene. What ensues is the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465602/"><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="first place goes to 'Shoot 'em Up (click for IMDB entry)">second best bonezone/gunfight action sequence ever filmed</span></a>.</p>
  <p>Milton and Piper are somehow able to track down King where the iconic eye-shooting out scene occurs, which gives King the opportunity to kidnap Piper. King and his cronies are able to haul ass out of the scene in an RV that would be the envy of Cousin Eddie from Christmas Vacation. King declares he's gonna kill Piper and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I'm curious how in intended to follow through on that claim since it's a known fact at this point that he's dickless">"defile her corpse"</span>. King falls victim to the same pendant stabbing for a second time. It's quite a curiosity how this tool became a leader if he can't employ basic common sense and ditch the one accessory that has caused him the most pain.</p>
  <p>Milton/Cage has quite the command of the local geography, particularly for having no idea where the town is that he's heading to. He splits off from the fleeing RV with the dickless kidnapping deviant, only to meet up with them later and rescue Piper - who it a bit astonished that he's alive (minus an eye).  The timeline gets a bit fuzzy, but at one point a chase scene with Fichtner/The Accountant crosses, what appears to be a mile long bridge. Fichtner's real feat is driving a truck with a giant tank of hydrogen through a police blockade following lock-step with the rule: If there's car in this movie it will flip over at some point. Also, Fichtner has the most racist line perhaps ever uttered in a non-historical cinematic history (see below)</p>
  <p>Finally, the climatic conclusion occurs - complete with inexplicable nudity. Only 2-3 of Dickless King's followers were in their full birthday suits. Cage saves the day in a muscle car using his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="A gun that is only used to kill non-god characters in the movie">"God Gun"</span> to kill Jonah King in a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="It's as if the production company forgot the movie was 'shot in 3D' and realized in the last 10-minutes that the entire movie was not in 3D. So, they haphazardly threw some 3D shots in the final scene and called it good.">spectacular psychedelic 3D explosion</span> . We end with Milton/Cage drinking a beer out of King's freshly cleaned out skull and Fichtner and Cage drive off into Hell together. The End Credits Roll to "Drive Angry" which was written and performed by Cage's son, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2000606/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Weston Cage.</a></p>

What's more, Cage is playing a character in the south, but doesn't have his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="The best rendition is from Con Air, I don't care what others think!">iconic southern accent</span>! Instead, he talks like his mouth is still numb from just receiving a root canal (and maybe still under the influence of the laughing gas...). Cage also walks around with his dirty harry pistol stuck in his belt - not properly holstered like every other one of his colleagues.  I'm not an expert in firearms or law enforcement requirements thereof, but I'm pretty sure having your firearm "holstered" in one's belt is not acceptable.</p>
  <p>The story and events are just as unhinged as Cage's character. At one point, Cage is inhaling smoke from a clubgoer he stopped. He soon starts making out with said clubgoer and receives a violent hand job while firing his gun in the air (see quote below). The next scene Cage is questioning an old woman about her grandson when the grandson randomly climbs in the window.</p>
  <p>Cage is basically on a mission to score drugs in any way possible, and solve the murder if he has time/feels like it. Cage also has a gambling problem. None of Cage's coworkers catch on to the fact that he's trippin' balls on cocaine most of the time. Cage has a license to freely roam about the city trying to solve a murder. It's rather impressive Cage is able to sustain his drug and gambling habit while barely functioning at a human level, let alone successfully pull off a murder investigation.</p>
  <p>Eventually, Cage's shenanigans catch up with him and he's stuck in the evidence room. Which works well for him to score drugs from evidence. While on this assignment he cleverly aligns himself with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944702/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Xzibit</a>. Cage hardly bats an eye as Xzibit's cronies dump a body in the harbor. Cage double crosses Xzibit after X kills off a mobster Cage owes money too.</p>
  <p>A string of good fortune assuages the debts and problems Cage has gotten himself into. Whether Cage pulled this off intentionally, or he's just one lucky coke-snorting-SOB is up for debate.</p>
  <p>You'd think the string of good luck would set Cage on the right track,  but he starts on the same old path he was at the beginning of the movie. Apparently this is a sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103759/?ref_=tt_rec_tti">Bad Lieutenant</a> with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000172/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Harvey Keitel</a>. Since it wasn't directed by Herzog I may actually want to watch it. Oh, and <a href="w.imdb.com/name/nm0000174/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Val Kilmer</a> is in this (before he <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Before he gained a massive amount of weight. Kilmer now looks like the ice CREAM man, not the Ice Man">"Blew up"</span>)</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: What the F*ck is a Microtesla?</h3><h6 align="center">Sh*t Just Happens - Professor Cage</h6><hr>
  <p>I don't always judge a movie by the previews, but when I do the previews serve as a good barometer. "Knowing" had some solid previews, one if which is another "Cage Joint" - <a data-reveal-id="AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a>. Astro Boy looks decent, basically a Disney version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>...Wait. Disney own's <a href="http://marvel.com/">Marvel</a>. So, a Dreamworks version of Iron Man.</p>
  <p>I like to think this movie also takes place in the <a data-reveal-id="Trespass">Trespass</a> universe. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0578853/?ref_=tt_cl_t15">Ben Mendelson</a> plays a colleague of Professor Cage. Before Cage becomes a professor, he was a diligent PI in <a data-reveal-id="mm8">8mm</a>. Cage lost his family and became a diamond dealer in <a data-reveal-id="Trespass">Trespass</a> where Ben robs him. Cage, fed up with the diamond life applies himself in the field of astrophysics (like his character in <a data-reveal-id="SorcerersApprentice">The Sorcerers Apprentice</a>) to the point of being able to travel back in time/to an alternate reality where Ben and him are now friends (due to the bond they forged during the hostage scenario in <a data-reveal-id="Trespass">Trespass</a>). The problem is that Professor Cage's time travel opened a rift in the space-time continuum causing a solar flare of several "microteslas" to destroys the planet. That's the story I wish was being told...it wasn't.</p>
  <p>This movie is legitimately creepy. A young seemingly possessed girl is hearing whispers. Thankfully I had the company of our two dogs to keep me safe from what I thought was starting as a horror/sci-fi movie. Said girl writes seemingly random numbers on a piece of paper to put in a time capsule. Professor Cage's slightly deaf son gets that same paper when the capsule is opened 5 decades later. So, the paper and pencil transfer the "possession". Professor Cage is oblivious at first, finding solace in his nights with whiskey and <a href="https://www.tivo.com/">TiVo</a>. Professor C. sets his whiskey glass down on the number sheet where it creates a water/whiskey ring around 9/11/01 - oh snap!</p>
  <p>Professor Cage goes manic on google, searching for dates on the sheet, but uses <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> to find lat/long coordinates. A true astrophysicist wouldn't use MapQuest. Cage discovers some dates that haven't occured yet. Expectedly, disasters occur as predicted on the sheet - complete with terrible CGI. I guess most of the movie budget was blown on Professor Cage so they had to hire an intern from some small liberal arts college to do all the CGI. </p>
  <p>Professor C's son is being followed by a creepy dude with bleached blond hair who hands out polished black rocks and shows up in his son's nightmarish visions. Cage goes into creepy <a data-reveal-id="Zandalee">Zandalee</a> stalker mode on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126284/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Rose Byrne</a>, then turns on the <a data-reveal-id="Next">Next</a> charm when coming clean about his stalker tendencies - inviting them out for ice cream. Cage buys a gun and reads the manual after sighting the blondie stalker. </p>
  <p>Rose, her daughter, Professor Cage, and his son take a field trip to the creepy ass abandoned trailer in the woods where Rose's mother Overdosed (Roses's mother was the creepy girl at the exposition). The creepy trailer scene well filmed with a Point-of-view approach. </p>
  <p>Creepy stalker dude shows up in the woods where Professor Cage grabs his gun (it's okay he's read the manual) and chases him down. Stalker blinds Professor C with a light emitted from his oral cavity. Cage discovered a model he ran for some outlying solar system will happen to our sun. Rose suggests they go to the Cave's for protection so they can become the family in <a href="">The Croods</a>. Cage discovers flares of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)">Microteslas</a> (&micro;T) will set the world afire. Which, if 1 microtesla = .001 Teslas, a several microtesla solar flare doesn't seem like a big deal - WRONG! During solar "quiet times" the disturbance to Earth's magnetic fields is &plusmn;20 nT (Nanoteslas, nT), solar super-storms produce a disturbance of > -250 nT. So, a solar flare causing a disturbance of several &micro;T (1 &micro;T/Micro Teslas = 1000 nT)would indeed be catostrophic. The science checks out, good work Cage! </p>
  <p>Cage drives like a boss with gun in hand to track down his kidnapped son. At this point, the creepy oral-light-emitting dude has kidnapped Professor C and Roes's children. Rose dies in pursuit. Cage finds them with the creepy stalker guys and each kid has a pet white rabbit now. The children are chosen by aliens and dropped off on CGI planet presumably to repopulate it - w/o any knowledge of reproduction other than watching their pet rabbits. So, their bunny pets are an allegory for the amount of sex these two kids are going to be required to have in order to repopulate their alien planet.</p>
  <p><img id="img" src="images/aliens.jpg"></p>
  <p>Professor C and family die in a firey hellscape. Solid Cage performance with diety like hair and Einstein-like intelligence. Cage is a true National Treasure.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: How Did this Fly Under the Radar?</h3><h6 align="center">I think we might be looking at a Cagaissance!</h6><hr>
  <p>Okay, so unlike <a data-reveal-id="TheRunner">"The Runner"</a> this WAS based on actual events (which puts it into a similarly creepy realm as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706/">Zodiac</a> - it's no <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Fincher</a> film though). Cage plays an Alaska State Trooper closing in on his last two weeks. Cusack is creepy as f*ck, and 50-cent plays a mildly ethical pimp. After watching some truly tragic Cage performances I was in need of something to revive my faith in Cage. After watching this I'm wondering if Cage is pulling a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/?ref_=nv_sr_2">McConaughey</a> (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-mcconaissance">The McConaissance</a>). Cage is slotted to be in <a data-reveal-id="Snowden">Snowden</a>, if he harnesses the same energy he did in this, we might be looking at a Cagaissance!</p>
  <p>Cage is thrust into a case during his last two weeks as an Alaska State Trooper. Cage is able to connect some rudimentary dots, then becomes a damn savant at picking out cold cases involving similar victims. Cage employs the help of his buddy "Doherty" from <a data-reveal-id="Rage">Rage</a> - the same buddy involved in the following exchange (from <a data-reveal-id="Rage">Rage</a>:

  <blockquote id="pQuote">Why aren't you at your house? <cite>Cage</cite>
    Because you don't bang strippers at your house <cite>Doherty</cite></blockquote>

   So, clearly Doherty knows about strippers. Which translates well to knowing the local prostitution scene in Anchorage. Cage and Doherty hunt down the last victim of serial murderer. Said victim, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="If that's even her real name...">Cindy</span> gets pressured into smoking some crystal meth by another <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Who claimed to be looking out for her...">"woman of the night"</span> to assuage the pressure of dancing in one of Anchorage's seedier bars (Cindy is a prostitute, who of course has "daddy/parent issues").  Cindy, freaks out when Cusack shows up (SPOILER!) - removing any doubt the viewer may have had about creepy Cusack being the murderer Cage is looking for.</p>
   <p>When Cusack catches sight of Cindy he sets people out to hunt her down. Cindy, while being chased decides to rip some fat rails of Peruvian flake off the toilet in a shi*tty women's bathroom in order to cope with the stress. In Cindy's haste she ends up overdosing on Columbian snow and finds herself in the hospital. Meanwhile <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1265067/">50 cent/Curtis James Jackson III</a> is trying to track Cindy down to settle a debt.</p>
   <p>A climatic conclusion starts to build when Cindy escapes from her hospital room to be found by 50/Pimp Clate Johnson. Cindy calls Cage in desperation, to which Cage instructs her to go to a Clate's house, instead of the police station - why? Eventually, Cage get's Cusack to cave and back himself into a corner during an interrogation (meanwhile the police are turning Cusack's residence upside down looking for evidence).</p>
   <p>This is one solid suspense/thriller! Cage dug down and pulled out a damn solid performance. If only he'd continued on the tragectory that this, <a data-reveal-id="Joe">Joe</a>, and <a data-reveal-id="DyingOfTheLight">Dying of the Light</a> had set him on...</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: What's the what?</h3><h6 align="center">B.A.D. Balls. Attitude. Direction</h6><hr>
  <p>There's a disappointing amount of Cage in this movie. He shows up shortly, then disappears for the next <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I was counting because only Cage could save this trainwreck">22 minutes</span>. Which is acceptable since there are so many good actors in this piece of garbage. Caruso was totally outclassed and comes off as a total "Rube". There are numerous scenes where actors just repeat lines in what seems like an attempt to fill silence - saying the line with more emphasis the second time.</p>
  <p>I wanted to think this was at least 'okay' back in 1995, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?sort=moviemeter,asc&title_type=feature&year=1995,1995">Se7en, Braveheart, Apollo 13, and The Usual Suspects</a> were all released that year, so it is actually a terrible movie. Despite Caruso getting sh*t on and being the victim the entire movie, I still was not rooting for him and hoping Cage would reform and become a good guy or something. Even if that meant he would have to give up his days <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="That was a great scene, one in which he was predictably in a sleeveless shirt.">bench pressing strippers</span>.</p>
  <p>Sam Jackson plays a good cop that was shot by the same <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I wish Caruso would have jumped in front of the bullet instead of just putting out his hand">bullet</span> Caruso tried to stop earlier in the movie resulting in an overactive tear duct - making him seem a bit 'bond villain-ish'</p>
  <p>Caruso ends up serving time in prison, during which his wife (played by Helen Hunt) is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="this is an assumption. But she wakes up in Caruso's cousin's bed with her pants undone">roofied</span> and gets killed in a car crash. So, classy Caruso marries his daughters babysitter from before he went to prison (played by Kathryn Erbe). Caruso resorts back to a life of crime, but is "undercover", serving as an informant for Sam Jackson's character (who has a vendetta from when he was shot in the eye). This strung together "Crime Drama" barely keeps your attention. I was pleased when Cage was freaking out after his father's death. By freaking out, I mean he was just jumping up and down in the strip club he calls home ( the same one where he bench presses the strippers). </p>
  <p>Cage kills Ving Rhames' character, who was actually an undercover Federal Agent (spoiler!). Yet the DA (played by Stanly Tucci) still won't prosecute. So, Caruso <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which are easy to hide in the baggy 1995 clothes everyone is wearing"> wears a wire</span> and get's Cage to confess at gunpoint (that would totally hold up in court). Disappointingly, Rube Caruso is off the hook and Cage is going to jail. I wish it had been the other way around. Gingerpuss Caruso should be locked up for the terrible acting he delivered in this movie, for which he was paid $1 million.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Why is it called "The Runner"?</h3><h6 align="center">Oh, I get it. It's a double entendre because he runs for office, and runs for exercise. Got it!</h6><hr>
  <p>For some reason I thought this was based on a true story. It's not, though it takes place in our reality (not Cage's reality where you find a <a data-reveal-id="NationalTreasure">200-year-old ship in the Arctic</a> or where people have <a data-reveal-id="Trespass">Kidney Brokers</a>). I tempered my expectations after noticing this "Cage-Joint" has a solid 2-star review on <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>.  Cage plays a congressman from Louisiana who gives an emotional and teary-eyed speech right after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Said speech gives him a lot of media traction, but his interracial affair with a cheerleading coach results in his resignation - offering perhaps the best line of the movie: <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Sadly, this wasn't spoken. It was a newspaper headline that flashed on screen for an all too brief moment">"Congressman caught onshore drilling"</span>.</p>
  <p>Also, I'm fairly certain parts of this were filmed in the same location(s) as <a data-reveal-id="Zandalee">Zandalee</a>. Sadly, there are no scenes where Cage hysterically slathers himself in black paint. Because he's from the South, Cage has a southern accent. Why does he keep doing southern accents?! </p>
  <p>Cage separates from his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Seriously, she's a cougar - complete with ferocity.">Cougar wife</span>, resigns from his elected office and focuses on his pro-bono legal operation helping victims of the oil spill. When suddenly $3.5 billion is dispersed to his firm from BP for compensation to victims. Of course, there's a catch. There's always a catch, which is that a morally questionable energy investor is willing to back Cage if he changes his stance on certain energy issues.</p>
  <p>As if Cage's life wasn't already in shambles. The flame with his publicist fizzles out, his cougar wife won't sign the divorce papers, and his father (played by <a href="">Peter Fonda</a>. Fonda and Cage together Again! ) dies in surgery. So, Cage breaks his sober streak and hires a prostitute (disclaimer: The events don't happen in exactly that order).</p>
  <p>Cage gets sauced up and drives to his old residence where he discovers his gate opener device no longer works. So, he drunkenly crashes through the gate and into the garage. Cage aquiesces to his wife's desire for him to run for a Senate Seat. End with Cage giving a boilerplate speech filled with clich&eacute;s.</p>
  <p>I found it hard to point out flaws or make fun of this movie....</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Better accent. Better hair. Better Cage.</h3><h6 align="center">There's a priest named Debalzaq....De bal zaq...</h6><hr>
  <p>Cage's accent in this is better than that in <a data-reveal-id="Outcast">Outcast</a> in that he didn't attempt one. His hair is better in that it looks slightly more natural...slightly. </p>
  <p>Cage again finds himself on the morally questionable endeavor of the Christan Crusades. When he accidentally impales a young innocent woman and meets her gaze he and Perlman decide to leave the Crusades, or it could have been the subpar set design and CGI - either reason would be valid for leaving the Crusades.</p>
  <p>Instead of venturing to Asia like in <a data-reveal-id="Outcast">Outcast</a>, Perlman and Cage wander the countryside where cage's wig/hair turns to brown from the previous blond colour. He requires the desert sun and stress of killing innocent lives in the name of Christianity to maintain his perfectly highlighted locks.</p>
  <p>When Perlman and Cage wander into a nearby town Cage becomes concerned that someone may recognize him so he puts a scar over his face - which really only draws more attention to him. They get pegged as deserters and learn that a plague has stricken the continent. Said plague is blamed on a witch, who needs to be escorted to a monastery for trial. Perlman and Cage are asked to do so, but elect to spend a night in the dungeon instead. Eventually, they acquiesce and escort the witch to the monastery - moving the story along nicely.</p>
  <p>There are some nice action scenes and tense moments involving wolves and demons. Perlman really stole the show from Cage in this one (evidenced by him having many more quotable lines). Perlman also headbutts a soldier wearing a helmet, and a Demon (just before being incinerated by said demon).</p>
  <p>I'm not sure if this movie exceeded my expectations because they were so low, or it was actually a somewhat decent (albeit campy) movie. While this may have only received 6 Cages out of 10, I think it's fair to give it 8.5 Perlmans out of 10.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Money can't buy happiness</h3><h6 align="center">A lonely Cage realizes he's meant for Jersey life.</h6><hr>
  <p>Open to cage kissing a distraught T&eacute;a Leoni in the airport who is pleading for him to not leave on a 1-year internship at Barclays in London. Jump 13 years later to Cage waking up in his New York City high-rise condo next to a beautiful woman (who is not Leoni) parading around singing <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Does Cage love the opera? This and Moonstruck would have us think so.">opera</span> in his undies while picking out his finest threads from a magnificent <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="This closet puts anything on HGTV to shame.">walk-in closet</span> (complete with floor to ceiling windows). Cage Drives a Ferrari. In nearly every Cage movie, he drives an awesome car, except for maybe <a data-reveal-id="TheRock">The Rock</a> where he drive's "A Volvo, a beige one" but we never actually see it. </p>
  <p>On Christmas Eve, Cage is walking home contemplating his life when it begins to snow. He swings into a liquor store to buy <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="who the hell actually likes eggnog?">eggnog</span> and ends up selflessly preventing a potentially bad scenario when <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000332/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Don Cheadle</a> tries to cash in a lottery ticket (This is one of two movies where his life changes due to the involvement of a lottery ticket, the other being <a data-reveal-id="ItCouldHappenToYou">It Could Happen To You</a>). After a brief dialog Cage states, he wants for nothing and saunters home to fall asleep in his black cotton briefs. Expectedly, Cage wakes up the next morning next to Leoni wearing boxers (in this alternate reality he's a boxers guy).</p>
  <p>Cage freaks out and takes the family minivan into town only to find that nobody recognizes him and Cheadle is driving his Ferrari. Turns out Cheadle is responsible for giving Cage a glimpse at the life he missed by taking that internship in London. In his "family man" life Cage sells tires for his father-in-law in Jersey while his wife is a non-profit attorney. They have two kids, and he's best buddies with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005315/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Jeremy Piven</a>.</p>
  <p>Cage is stuck in this alternate reality for a few weeks, suffering from what he estimates is a terrible wardrobe complete with flannel pajamas. His daughter instructs him through the daily morning routine, after which he goes to his wood-paneled office at "Big Ed's Tires". Cage, disgusted with the choices his alternate self has made immediately takes to drinking to numb the pain.</p>
  <p>Cage evalutes his life options and finds old home videos to watch, in which he sings to Leoni for her birthday - terribly. So his alternate self doesn't develop the set of pipes he uses to sing opera. If Cage never made it as an actor, he certainly had a future as a operatic underwear model.</p>
  <p>Cage slowly realizes how fulfilling his Jersey life would be, only to be sent back to his old "Big City Life". Cage realizes how lonely and sh*tty his "Big City Life" is and tracks down Leoni who had a box of his old possessions for the past 13 years. Said box contained a bottle of booze or perfume (I couldn't tell which. Cage only sniffed it), a Yo-Yo, and a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle">Cat's Cradle</a> with a set of photos from a photo booth of Cage and Leoni. Eventually, Cage talks Leoni into not leaving for Paris (Oh, Leoni is packing up her belongings for a move to Paris) and the movie closes with them talking in an empty airport terminal.</p>
  <p>This is a classic Christmas movie complete with references to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/?ref_=nv_sr_3">It's a Wonderful Life</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029992/?ref_=nv_sr_2">A Christmas Carol</a>. This is actually a solid Cage performance - better than his Oscar Performance from <a data-reveal-id="LeavingLasVegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a>, it's turning out most of his performances are.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: why? just, why?</h3><h6 align="center">His accent is like listening to eskimos club baby seals. I can't watch this anymore - <i>Erin</i></h6><hr>
  <p>Erin suggested we spend some time in the Cage and stated that "well, we might as was well watch one of the worst ones we can." I made the mistake of checking IMDB reviews on "Outcast" before we start watching it - bad idea. The first one was titled "avoid at all costs". It has just over 1 star on Netflix. Cage has a Middle Eastern/Middle Ages/nebulous European accent - trumping all other terrible Cage accents to date except for "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Henceforth referred to as 'Anakin'">Christiansen</span> is just an opium-addicted toolbag. Honestly, even Kevin Costner gave up trying an accent in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102798/?ref_=nv_sr_3">Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</a>, why did Cage have to stick with it?</p>
  <p>Erin took her glasses off after 8 minutes - deciding that a blurry viewing was better than watching it in focus. Also, Cage is in the first 5 minutes or so, then doesn't appear again until nearly an hour into this horrific disaster.  I don't often look forward to screen time without Cage, but the less time I had to listen to his trainwreck of an accent, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="by better, I mean suck marginally less.">the better this movie got</span>. In the meantime, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="The mysterious warrior">Anakin</span> teams up with the prince and princess mentioned in the description. Also, the emperor isn't deposed, he's assassinated by his dickhead of a son. The d-bag older son frames his younger brother for their father's assassination and so the two embark on their escape journey.</p>
  <p>It's never made clear why both Anakin and Cage end up the far east after their tenure as Chrisitan Crusaders in the Middle East. The most likely explanation is Cage and Anakin playing D&amp;D with some young Asian children for 1.5 hours and this film/story is the result.</p>
  <p>The aforementioned events take place in the "far east" three years after the exposition. But, despite the geographical location everybody speaks English fluently! Anakin re-enters the story as tripping balls on opium in a bar near some canyon with an abundance of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I can only surmise the population of hawks is booming since there was a hawk scream every 30 seconds.">Red Tail Hawks</span>. Anakin gets pissed on by one of the guards in pursuit of the prince and princess. The piss induces sudden-onset-sobriety and he goes all "Vader" on them (killing most of them). </p>
  <p>A reluctant Anakin agrees to help the two young royalty. Of course, they happen upon a village that has been decimated by black guards (those in pursuit of the two youngsters Padawan Anakin is now helping). Anakin demonstrates his f*cking Zen Archer skills by taking down a guard on a horse from 150-200 meters. The impact of the arrow on said guard drives <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="This is the medieval equivalent to a car blowing up from hitting a speed bump.">the horse into the ground like it just hit a trip wire at full sprint</span>. The two siblings convince Anakin to take on a fourth to their party using the rationale that the guards are looking for a party of three, not four. This was the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which isn't saying much since this movie makes no sense and has zero character development.">most rational moment in the entire story line</span>. The fourth party member speaks English of course though this one has a fairly pronounced British accent. Which makes total sense when she's from a rural Chinese mountain village!</p>
  <p>The young prince is like an annoying Asian Jayden Smith - insisting that Anakin teach him the Zen Archer ways. Cut to a scene in what I assume is the Gobi desert and the four tag onto a middle eastern caravan where the leader speaks, you guessed it, English! The cold, calculating, leader of the caravan sells out and Anakin ends up bound and gagged. A parkour-ish scene ensues wherein Anakin cuts his ropes using a candle flame instead of a blade from a recently subdued pursuant. More vexing is how Anakin is able to subdue/kill so many guards who are presumably well versed in martial arts. Anakin just knows Western European swordsmanship (and has honed zen archery skills).</p>
  <p>Finally, Cage reappears with no improvement to accent and crazier hair. Moreover, Cage now keeps live snakes around his wrists as ornaments. He's a crazy, one-eyed, snake charmer now. (This, I learned was Cage "exploring his character" according to an interview. Cage is known for improving/doing crazy sh*t, but the cycloptic, snake-wearing, mountain man is a whole new level!) <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I assume through some sort combination of Stockholm Syndrome and hypnotism"> Somehow</span> Cage has found a woman to marry him as well. His wife has no lines, probably because she didn't speak English. This small detail is explained by Cage, stating her tongue was cut out by the guards in pursuit of Anakin and the young royalty.</p>
  <p>A climactic battle ensues, where Cage heroically takes on an army and subsequently <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Does it count as a 'Cage kill' if he's responsible for his own death?">gets himself killed</span>. Anakin has a showdown with the dick of an older brother. The older brother kills his sister, who Anakin has a "thing with". Anakin gets a the typical/predicted second wind and kills the dick older brother.</p>
  <p>The announcement of a sequel in April of 2014 means it must have made some money, somehow. I couldn't find any information on budget and gross for this one.  </p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Hopefully your favorite color is red</h3>
  <h6 align="center">This movie is about who can be the least terrible human being.</h6><hr>
  <p>I think this is Cage in his actual truck/vehicle post-bankruptcy, which is a mid 80's Chevy Silverado.  I wanted this to be good, but half way in I still wasn't sure what the plot was. I think it was meant to be one of those "slow" stories with deep characters. Sadly, Cage was outclassed by the 15-year-old kid - severely.</p>
  <p>Basically, Cage runs a crew that goes around and poisons trees for lumber companies. You might ask, "wouldn't it just be easier to cut them down?". Yes. Yes, it would. But, it is stated in the movie that the lumber company can't cut down live trees, only dead ones. I'm guessing this was a fabricated regulation so they could avoid the inflated insurance costs of having chainsaws on set.</p>
  <p>Cage has few lines but does demonstrate impeccable accounting practices. Perhaps those would have been useful when he was contemplating the purchase of a 16-foot geode. It appears he did get into pretty decent shape for this movie, presumably to show off his impressive man-boobs. There are at least two scenes (maybe more) where Joe/Cage visits a brothel, but the only upper torso nudity we get is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which isn't as nicely manicured as in 'Valley Girl', but it's made up for in volume">Cage's magnificent chest</span>.</p>
  <p>There were only two climactic events. The young boy's sh*thead drunk of a father kills another bum for Boone's Farm. Boone's Farm! That's like Capri Sun for adults. No <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="a contradiction in terms">self-respecting alcoholic</span> would buy Boone's Farm when they there numerous other choices at a similar purchase price - all with higher alcohol content.</p>
  <p>The second climactic event is actually meant to be that of the story - when Cage/Joe confronts the boy's father and another dumb-dumb assaulting the kid's sister. Cage racks up two kills, and what we deemed a third since his presence motivates the kid's deadbeat father to jump off a bridge.</p>
  <p>Also, worth of mention is that Joes is renowned for both evading and fighting with the police and has racked up a couple DUI's.  Of course, he's treated with incredible leniency - a luxury that would not be afforded to him if his skin were a different color.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: If you can dodge a plane, you can dodge the rapture</h3>
  <h6 align="center">They're putting us in purgatory just watching this film - <i>Tim Garrett</i></h6><hr>
  <p>First of all, if the one sentence synopsis is accurate, the rapture of millions would leave behind <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Billions!">billions</span> of people - allowing life to continue as usual. In reality, the rapture of a "millions" would simply ease some hunger and economic issues, but that's about it.</p>
  <p>It's bad when you have no expectations for a movie, and it falls below your expectations. Shot with the lighting and quality of a mid 90's soap opera, "Left Behind" leaves behind current filming conventions to create a tragically boring 2-hour "story" about the onset of a biblical apocalypse. A brief cut scene to a family photo shows us an obviously photoshopped in Nic Cage - a foreshadowing of just how low budget this $16 million dollar "after school special" is. They didn't even have the budget to snap a photo with all the characters in it.  I'm guessing they saved all their money for the shoddy special effects scenes involving plane crashes that resembled the quality of a Full Motion Video (FMV) on the original Playstation (which were damn cool in 1993).</p>
  <p>For a solid 30 minutes nothing happens except for Captain Steel being "disappointed" that he didn't get better seats to the U2 show in London (if only he didn't buy that T-Rex skull and 16 foot geode he could have afforded better seats. Wait, that was Nic Cage, not his character. Still, the joke plays.)</p>
  <p>At the 0:32-minute mark people are finally raptured, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="that's an actual character's name">Raymie</span> is raptured through a terrible cut scene involving lazily switched cameras. Human nature at this point is to freak out like Cage's character <a data-reveal-id="Deadfall">"Deadfall"</a>. Looting and mayhem in the streets are accompanied by traffic jams and fires erupting all over the city. Passengers on the plane demand to know where their children went like it's some elaborate prank.  To make matters worse, Captain Steel/Cage has to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="a feeble attempt to 'grab' the viewer who should be entirely disengaged at this point">deal with mechanical failures on the plane</span>. Kudos to the crack research team that elected to find the correct aeronautical terms, but overlooked the fact that unbaptized babies cannot be raptured.</p>
  <p>All electronic communications are down nearly at once, despite the fact that they're mostly autonomous in this day and age. That, and most of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="especially those in the tech and communications sectors">incredibly smart people</span> on this planet are atheist at best. So, with no information from the outside world Captain Steel/Cage is able to surmise that the rapture is occurring by finding a left over watch from his raptured co-pilot's personal effects. John 3:16 and a bible is enough for Captain Steel to be as confident as Sherlock Holmes in his findings.  </p>
  <p>We're left with the moral of the story being:<br>
   <center>"It's not about what you did, it's about asking for forgiveness" ~ <i>pastor dude</i></center><br>
   After two hours, we were still left wondering what the actual point was. Seemingly good people weren't raptured, even though they all essentially believe in the same thing. Somewhat ironically, all the irritating characters were raptured - <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="if all the irritating and irrational people are presumably there">which makes one question how great heaven might be?</span>.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: 25% Sci-Fi, 75% Action - 100% CAGE!</h3>
  <h6 align="center">"This is literally the best movie about face swapping ever made! - <i>Paul Scheer</i></h6><hr>
  <p>The face swapping made it super hard to track "Cage Kills" and "Cage Freakouts". Do I just count everything Cage does on screen? Or does it count during the face swap part of the movie? Basically, all kills and freakouts are either Cage or Castor Troy as Sean Archer (technically Travolta). So counts may be a bit inaccurate for this one. Also, I learned this <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/"><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="thanks HDTGM!">movie was improved - A LOT!</span></a> Perhaps the most notable poor improve choice is Travolta's face petting/face waterfalls. This weird sign of affection is the same thing people do to shut the eyes of the a recently deceased person.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/?ref_=nv_sr_1">John Woo</a> does not disappoint in his 2nd American directorial effort! The movie opens with a mustachioed Castor Troy (Nic Cage, fresh from shooting <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118880/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Con Air</a>) in a nice public park with a sniper rifle aimed at Sean Archer (Travolta). Castor accidentally ends up killing Archer's son, when only trying to kill Archer. So the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Jason Mantzoukis of HDTGM emphasized this, it was an astute observation">movie opens with the cold-blooded [accidental] killing of a child!</span> Out of the gate, this movie is straight up crazy.</p>
  <p>Cut to 6 years later with Castor in full religious regalia (a priest I think) dancing around a public area and groping a teenage choir girl. Followed closely by a hummer/helicopter/plane chase scene and shootout - all within the first 15 minutes. Castor Troy is 'neutralized' and ends up in a coma, which allows for the face swapping procedure - turning Archer into Troy in order to extract the information about a bomb hidden somewhere in LA. The surgical procedure shown makes face swapping look easier than pulling apart an oreo. Apparently, if you just cut around the perimeter of the face you can just lift it off. It's so easy, you can give the patient a hair cut during said procedure.</p>
  <p>Sean Archer/Cage (face/identity swap has occurred at this point) is sent to a prison to extract vital information from Castor Troy's brother - Pullox. This prison isn't known to Amnesty International and doesn't have to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions"><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which makes sense since the Geneva Convention[s] really only apply to POWs (click for Wikipedia's info on the Geneve Conventions)">Geneva Convention</span></a>. The floor is magnetized, so prisoners had to wear boots - which were recycled from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108255/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Super Mario Bros</a> Movie. Through a calculated move, Archer (as Castor) is able to escape the prison and jumps into the ocean and swims to shore (which is within sight). So this "secret prison" is just a decrepit/repurposed oil rig of the California coast. The prison guards just assumed he was dead, I guess they didn't wait to see if he popped back up to the surface at any point in his 5-mile swim back to shore.</p>
  <p>The plot thickens when Castor wakes from his coma and re-enters the population as Sean Archer, killing everyone that knows about the secret face swapping operation in the process. Which is a bit of a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="of which there are a few">confusing plot hole</span>, why did this operation have to be such a secret? If they're sending Archer (as Castor) to a high-security prison where the only exposure to media is stock video footage of nature scenes, why couldn't everyone at the anti-terrorism bureau know about the operation to help prevent the exact scenario the movie is predicated on? This glaring loophole isn't without an upside, though. The moral side of Castor surfaces when he's living with Archer's family (as Archer of course). Over the course of a week, he decides to heal this broken family, by flirting with Archer's daughter and giving Joan Allen some good lovin'.</p>
  <p>An epic showdown occurs complete with Woo's signature dove's flying around. The climactic boat chases rife with explosions ends when Castor (as Archer) is impaled with a harpoon -  you know, a common tool on speedboats. The closing scene has Archer bringing Castor's now orphaned son into the house stating, "this is Adam, he needs a home".  No discussion, just "hey, let's adopt this child of a psychotic international terrorist!". Oh, and there's face waterfalls to ensure Archer is truly Archer at this point.</p>
  <p>If you don't follow <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/">"How Did This Get Made"</a>, I highly recommend listening to their live discussion of "Face/Off". They discuss John Travolta's improved <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Face+Waterfall">Face Waterfalls</a> in depth as well. In reality, there is way too much in this fine entry in the Cage Cannon to respectfully summarize - do yourself a favor and watch it while giving yourself a face waterfall.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Cage gets Shakespearean (by reading Shakespeare)</h3><h6 align="center">Guy Pearce is a bad guy? Again?</h6><hr>
  <p>According to IMDB, this screenplay was one of the most liked unmade films in 2009. So, they decided to take what could have been a good movie and settle for decent.</p>
  <p>The movie opens on a hidden camera interview with the interviewer asking what "The hungry rabbit jumps" means. The interviewee gets nervous and bolts, only to be pushed off the top of a parking garage by some goon in a large SUV. The unknown interviewee plummets a couple stories in his BMW onto a bus. He would have most certainly survived since Cage has survived worse whilst unbuckled (read <a data-reveal-id="Stolen">Stolen review</a>).</p>
  <p>Link from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_50">Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions</a> is a coworker of Cage's whom we later learn is part of this secret vigilante organization (spoiler), but also plays chess with Cage. Cage demonstrates little chess prowess, but the scene foreshadows the rest of the story quite well (I'll attribute that little nuance to producer Tobey Maguire!). Link gets Cage into a checkmate and chides him for 'playing it too safe'.</p>
  <p>While Cage is hamming it up with Link on the Chessboard, a guy in snakeskin boots starts to follow Cage's wife (played by January Jones). You immediately know he's evil from his boots. He assualts Jones, but Cage isn't aware because of course the rules of the community Chess hall are such that phones must be turned off. Cage pulls a NardDog/Andrew Bernard freakout in the hospital bathroom by kicking a trashcan.</p>
  <p>Enter Guy Pearce (character name Simon) who offers Cage sweet justice against his wife's attacker. No police, clean and simple. Only Cage will owe a favor sometime in the future. Cage is so distraught at this point he doesn't understand the very clear euphemisms Simon is speaking in so Simon has to spell out the offer/scenario for him. Cage indicates he wants the job done by buying two "forever" bars from the vending machine (another foreshaddowing).</p>
  <p>6 months later Cage is approached by Simon. Predictably, it's time for Cage to settle up on his debt to Simon by killing another miscreant/scum of society. Also predictably, Cage disobeys orders and finds himself in quite a pickle. At this point, any semi-intelligent viewer is asking, "Why doesn't Simon and his organization just take care of these poeple instead of bringing rookie people that will screw up?"</p>
  <p>Cage ultimately follows through, albeit somewhat accidentally, only to find out he's been set up/framed. Cage attends a visitation in a local bar for the guy he bumblingly killed. Everyone there turns the event into <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/69478">SNL Bill Brasky</a> rip off.</p>
  <p>Obligatory chase scene ensues where Cage runs just a little bit less geriatrically than he does in Stolen. Bumbling Cage manages to evade his pursuants and get one of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="The 2nd technical Cage Kill of the movie">them killed</span>. Bumbling Cage finds his victim is actually in investigative journalist looking into Simon's secret vigilante group. He's almost caught when riffling through his victim's office late night. But his impressive command of the English grammar and punctuation gets him off the hook (he is an English teacher after all).</p>
  <p>The second obligatory chase scene ensues where Cage tries to outrun a train. But, without his future seeing powers from <a href="#" data-reveal-id='Next'>Next</a> he opts to play it safe and just ram the pursuant police car under a tractor trailer - good call.</p>
  <p>Cage uncovers the evidence his vicitm has compiled, which conveiently plays in the dash of the Cadillac Escalade he has stolen. The classic showdown unfolds wherein a polic officer who's a member of Simon's organization shows up and states "looks like a case of a two dead guys killing each other". </p>
  <p>Overall, a fairly mediocre Cage performance. Not crazy, not epic. Just middle of the road - except for box office earnings. Those were a Shakespearean tragedy.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: I'm gonna dissapear it.</h3>
  <h6 align="center">You mean...like...taken?</h6><hr>
  <p>This movie came out four years after the original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">"Taken"</a>, and only beat <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1397280/?ref_=nv_sr_3">"Taken 2"</a> by a month. But, "Taken" didn't involve a bank heist, so it's obviously different. Also, Cage doesn't have a "specific set of skills" to go on a murderous rampage while getting his daughter back (Like Neeson does) - Hell, Cage didn't even know what a <a href="#gps">GPS</a> was in this movie!</p>
  <p>The movie opens on a desolate street, populated only by a drunk guy singing at the top of lungs. Said drunk vocalist stops to relieve himself, at which point I was really hoping this guy was Nic Cage...it wasn't. Instead, the movie cuts to Cage rockin' out in a van to CCR. Apparently his character uses CCR to get pumped up before a job - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187078/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="remember 'Low Rider, Donny' from 'Gone in 60-seconds? (click for IMDB Entry)">basically directly ripping off Memphis Raines' getting pumped routine.</span></a></p>
  <p>This movie was disappointing in that it was not a classic Cage performance, nor was it a terrible Cage performance. It was painfully mediocre. Basically, the heist Cage is getting pumped for at the exposition is botched and everyone goes unpaid for their efforts. This is particularly hard for Lucas' character to cope with, despite the fact that Cage's character took the fall for everyone involved! When Cage is cornered by the police he burns the money to avoid a longer prison sentence. The rest of his crew gets off while Cage serves an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="during which time hair dye was made readily available, and maybe hair plugs?">8-year prison sentence</span>.</p>
  <p>Upon Cage's release, he is picked up from prison by the FBI agents who caught him - complete with the lead agent wearing the dumbest looking Pork Pie hat! This hat makes him the least threatening federal agent in cinematic history. Cage get's a package (I don't remember how it was delivered) containing a Blackberry, which was an all but dead technology in 2012. Aside from the pork pie hat, the use of Blackberries is the greatest crime committed in this movie.</p>
  <p>Lucas' character kidnaps Cage's daughter and demands $10 million which is supposedly his share of the lost fortune from the botched heist 8 years prior. In the time since, Lucas' character decided to "fly under the radar" by convincing everyone that he was dead. In order to do this Lucas "dug up a body (which wasn't hard), chopped into little bits, and added little bits of himself to the mix" - which makes him sound like a psychotic necrophiliac! Also worth mentioning is that he soundproofed the trunk and took care to add glow in the dark stars like the ones you put on you ceiling when you were 5-years-old. </p>
  <p id="gps">For being an action movie lasting 96 minutes, it does move at a mostly glacial pace. Once Cage steals a cab and points to a GPS asking the cabbie "what's this!?!" the movie picks up in pace a bit.  The last 30 minutes consists of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A chase scene where Cage geriatrically runs over the tops of cars when he could just run on the street much more easily.</li>
    <li>Cage breaks his wrist or thumb to get out of handcuffs, then incapacitates two federal agents driving the car he's in. The car flips and Cage walks away from the accident to answer the Blackberry Lucas is calling him on. Cage immediately regains full use of the hand he injured to get out of handcuffs.</li>
    <li>Cage calls his old crew member and talks in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="to let her know it's a serious call">Swedish</span> to get her to meet and recruit her for one last job to save his daughter</li>
    <li>Cage and partner steal $10 million from a bank by burning a hole in the vault floor and melting the gold through the hole. This would result in about 400 lbs of gold which they drag/lift/transport rather easily.</li>
    <li>Cage meets Lucas in a derelict amusement park/fairgrounds where his daughter is stuck in the trunk of the taxi which is lit on fire. Cage solves the problem by driving the burning car off a dock into a body of water.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the last scene, Cage works to rescue his daughter. Then, he impales Lucas with a large pry bar and shuts him in the trunk. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which was in chest deep water the whole time">The car</span> then sinks 50 feet or more. The film concludes with a cute barbecue involving Cage,  Malin Ackerman, and Cage's daughter where one last bit of gold is found. Cage contemplates the consequences of keeping the gold for a bit then declares "I'm gonna disappear it"</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Where are the Bandaids in an Ambulance?</h3><h6 align="center">Paramedics don't patrol, and I'm pretty sure they don't drink on the job...</h6><hr>
  <p>I'm not exactly sure what a "Comedy, Drama, Thriller" is, but I'm certain this wasn't it. I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000217/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Martin Scorcese</a> (who voiced one of the dispatches), but I'm reluctant to group this movie in with his finer work. The only thing more epic than the number of freakouts was the awesomely 90's soundtrack.</p>
  <p><img align="right" src="images/rose.gif">I was under the impression paramedics hang out at one location and wait to get dispatched, not drive around on patrol like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242949/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_112">The Tick</a> (which was awesome! <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0911320/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Patrick Warburton</a> was great in that series) ogling at hookers, beating on drug addicts (which they do in this movie), and drinking on the job. Basically, Cage is haunted by the ghost of a girl he wasn't able to save because he kept putting the intubation tube into her stomach. I don't know which I grew more tired of, seeing Rose (pictured right), or waiting for this 2-hour introspection to conclude.</p>
  <p>Cage copes with his stress, hallucinations, and lack of sleep by drinking. Cage is introspective and looks likes like hell - worse than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001570/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Ed Norton</a> at the beginning of <a href="">Fight Club</a> (Norton quickly passes Cage though).  Cage and his partner(s) (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">John Goodman</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000609/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Ving Rhames</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001744/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">Tom Sizemore</a>) encounter a slew of cases, one of which is a supposed virgin, Maria, giving birth to a set of breach twins - both coming out at once. I'm no medical expert, but I'm guessing Twins don't enter the birth canal in tandem.</p>
  <p>Cage in desperate need of a good nap follows <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000099/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Patricia Arquette</a> to an "Oasis" where he is persuaded into taking some nebulous drugs from Whale Rider (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193295/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Cliff Curtis</a>, the father from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298228/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_27">Whale Rider</a>). Cage proceeds to trip balls while getting some sleep, then move into a truly epic freakout scene.</p>
  <p>Cage becomes borderline psychotic and gives himself a cocktail of vitamins and such intravenously. They end up on a call that involves Whale Rider impaled on the railing of a 14th story balcony, wherein they do not secure him at all before cutting the railing - rookie move!</p>
  <p>Cage hallucinates some more, then succumbs to the voices in his head/hallucinations and kills the original patient he saved by putting the pulse monitor on himself and breathing into the tracheotomy tube. I would been much happier if the credits rolled right after Rames and Cage crashed and flipped their ambulance (which at about the 1-hour mark).  This was part <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Fight Club</a> and part <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_25">The Machinist</a> without the greatness of Tyler Durden or the craziness of Bale.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Dangerously Delicious (not really)</h3><h6 align="center">It's not what I was expecting. But then, I don't know what I was expecting.</h6><hr>
  <p>I'm not sure what lowered my expectations more, the title of the movie (perhaps the worst title in the Cage Cannon), or the previews. I usually humor the production company and watch previews on a DVD - not this time! The previews consisted of the following: <br>
     <img align="right" src="images/bangkok_images/bangkok_hair.jpg">
     <ul id="pList">
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179891/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2">My Bloody Valentine</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831887/?ref_=nv_sr_4">The Spirit</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132626/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Saw V</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213644/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Disaster Movie</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1046163/?ref_=nv_sr_2">My Best Friends Girl</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479884/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Crank </a>(F*ck Yeah Chev Chelios. This movie is awesome!)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Lord of War</a></li>

  Okay. So 5/7 previews were garbage, which was plenty to lower my expectation considerably - that and Cage's hair. Cage is portrayed as a loner assassin with virtually no ties to humanity. In an early sequence, Cage perfectly times a sniper kill shot with clock bell tower chime. Which seems intelligent, but the trajectory of his bullet can still be traced to the general vicinity in which he <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Triggers are squeezed, not pulled, as we learn from Cage later">squeezed the trigger</span></p>
  <p>This is a remake of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0263101/">Thai Version of Bangkok Dangerous</a>. A story about a deaf/mute hitman that befriends an innocent pharmacist and finds himself struggling with the morality of incredibly immoral profession. In the Cage version, the love interest is deaf so Cage can provide his epic voiceover. Cage's hair should have gotten credit in a supporting role, as it helped distract the viewer from his crazy looks and mostly monotone delivery of dialog.</p>
  <p><img align="right" src="images/bangkok_images/bangkok_fashion.jpg">If you can look past Cage's disastrous fashion choices and his trainwreck hair you can see not one, but two budding romances. One with the aforementioned deaf pharmacist, and the other with his helper - Kong. You can choose which one is more believable. I can't reconcile Cage's erratic and terrible fashion choices with his donning of a $2,000 watch and use of iconic BMW motorcycles. </p>
  <p>Initially, Cage seems quite <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="that confused looking goon wearing a polo pictured above is a professional assassin!">ruthless</span> - incapacitating and killing his lacky/helper using a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="He insulates himself against shock using a latex glove. That's a bit of a stretch. But this is a Nic Cage movie, so falls in the wide 'gray area' of believeability">taser</span> then issuing a lethal dose of heroine to said lacky. Hard to believe that a ruthless assassin wears a "space spirit" shirt when sight-seeing in Thailand...</p>
  <p>Soon we transition to Bangkok with a solid voiceover from Cage explaining his personal rules for surviving his trade, which we know he's only going to break (otherwise this wouldn't be a very interesting movie). In Bangkok Cage recruits a young helper (named Kong) for his tenure in the city. Cage's first job is to gun down some dudes in a car. During his quick getaway, he scrapes his arm - which allows him to win over a deaf pharmacist by showing off his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="His scathed but sculpted glistening biceps.">injured guns</span>.</p>
  <p>Cage also takes on a "Master Splinter" role - training Kong in his ways as an assassin. Said training consist of practicing a few basic hand-to-hand combat maneuvers and using an unidentified local fruit as target practice. Kong is elated, Cage remains emotionless.</p>
  <p>Of course Cage is lovestruck by the deaf pharmacist and asks her to dinner. What the hell are an American and deaf Thai pharmacist going to talk about over dinner, let alone HOW are the going to talk/communicate? This isn't an issue for long as Cage quickly dispatches of two would-be muggers. Luckily, the deaf pharmacist can't hear the gunshots. But, Cage's haste gets the best of him when deaf pharmacist discovers blood spatter on her blouse.</p>
  <p>Cage finds himself embroiled in a moral dilemma. He's always told himself those he was paid to kill were "Bad to Somebody", but when he's tasked with killing a nationally loved politician he can't squeeze the trigger - setting off a tragic chain of events. Before Cage embarks on what will be his demise he visits the deaf pharmacist one last time to apologize and flash puppy dog eyes at her.</p>
  <p>In a fairly well done final action sequence Cage effortlessly dispatches of henchman guarding the guy who has been paying him for the assassinations. One such dispatching involved the use of grenade at close range to literally blow a guy half. Also, Cage trades shots with a guy between pallets of large 5-gallon water bottles, which would stop bullets quite easily - <a href="http://mythbustersresults.com/episode34">Mythbusters</a> confirmed that most bullets are all but stopped in 3 feet of water. The pallets consisted of at least 3 rows of bottles, with each likely being at least 10" in diameter. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="He did find a 200+ year old wooden ship in the Arctic under &lt; 2ft of snow in 'National Treasure' (way less believable).">Again, this falls into the gray area of "believability" in the Cage Cannon</span>.</p>
  <p>Cage reluctantly kills himself and the final bad guy with a single bullet. We're left with 0 freakouts and a lackluster ending.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Sh*t got Radical</h3><h6 align="center">Kill his daughter and he'll cut you, even if you had nothing to do with her death. </h6><hr>
  <p>They tried for a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="where they show the end of the story then rewind and show how the character arrived in that scenario">'Tarantino opening'</span>, but it was a half-hearted attempt at best. I was surprised to see Danny Glover in this. While he's certainly in no <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093409/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Lethal Weapon</a> shape, and it wasn't an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109127/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Angels in the Outfield</a> performance, he still did a solid job.</p>
  <p>We're meant to be convinced that Cage's daughter was kidnapped, then murdered and tossed in a creek while he and his wife were out to dinner. Before heading out to dinner Cage offers a job to Mike (one of his daughter's friends) for "real money" without knowing the kid at all. When they arrive back at the house after being notified of the incident Cage assumes it's retribution from the Russian Mafia from when he, Kane, and Doherty stole money from the Russians 20 years ago. We learn of Cage's past transgressions in the form of a flashback where a younger Cage is played by none other than his son <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2000606/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Weston Cage!</a><p>
  <p>It's totally wise to just assume the worst and go on a rampage all over town killing people willy nilly. Cage does all this despite Francis'/The Russian from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_131">Armageddon</a> (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001780/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">Peter Stormare</a> - Gaear from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_142">Fargo</a>/Nihilist #1 from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/?ref_=nv_sr_1">The Big Lebowski</a>) pleas to not do just that. Before embarking on a murderous rampage of killing Russians, Cage takes the time to hand in his daughter's report on Caesar - because why not. Her teacher surely wants to read a half-assed report and then have to lie her parents by telling them it was f*cking Shakespearean.  Cage's wife disapproves of his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="his killing, not handing the report into his daughter's teacher">actions</span>. Cage Freaks out, chokes his wife, makes out with her and they both cry. Again, all this plays because it's a Cage movie.</p>
  <p>Cage, Kane, and Doherty visit a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="you can't unsee the weekday day shift at a strip club">strip club during the day</span> to find a Russian mafioso. Despite the time of day, there are numerous women dancing for virtually no patrons at all. So, this of obviously a money-laundering front because it makes absolutely no fiscal sense to have that many employees working with so little demand for their services.</p>
  <p>Cage finds the guy he's looking for and a geriatric running chase scene similar to <a data-reveal-id="Stolen">Stolen</a> ensues. The filmmakers also relied heavily on camera shake in the chase and fight scenes - which is just lazy. Cage catches the Russian and an incredible freakout scene unfolds with him beating the snot out of an already dead Russian Mafia guy.</p>
  <p>What I assume is that night. Our "Three Muskateers" enter a Russian crack house and light it up. Cage is almost killed when he pauses to look at <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Thinking with his 'Little Cage' almost got 'big Cage' killed">young woman sleeping in a bedroom</span>. Cage sadistically stabs a guy and watches him wail and crawl down the hall to fish out other bad guys.</p>
  <p>The actions of our Muskateers catch up to them and Kane is taken by the Russian Mafia. Cage follows in his sweet stock Ford Mustang, wreaking havoc all over the city in the requisite chase scene. The cops corner him, but as usual, Cage is able to get out of being arrested for multiple offenses (channeling his persona from <a data-reveal-id="Joe">Joe</a>). </p>
  <p>An upset Cage freaks out and kills <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="This is where Doherty's best line is uttered">Doherty</span> for not preventing the death of Kane. While driving home from murdering his friend Cage is able to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Finally!">connect the dots</span>. It took him and his friends racking up a large number of casualties for him to remember he had a box of f*cking guns in his closet that weren't locked up! Mild oversight to say the least. Cage figures out that the Russian issue gun led to his false assumption of Russian Mafia involvement and that the gun used to kill his daughter was his that he kept from the "heist" 20 years ago. Cage figures it out and scares a confession out of Mike.</p>
  <p>A tragically acted flashback scene unfolds where 17-year-olds are prancing around the house drinking and waving guns at one another like f*cking 8-year-olds with Super Soakers. Essentially, this entire movie devolved into a 90 minute PSA about gun safety, and how guns should be kept unloaded and locked in a safe.</p>
  <p>I don't think Mike will be getting that job offer from Cage since he accidentally killed his daughter. And, because Cage is dead. Mike's going to be stuck working at his current employer, Denny's, for a long time.</p>
  <p>Again, if cage allows himself to be killed does it count as a Cage kill?</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Hello Beautiful</h3><h6 align="center">Cage finds the treasure and gets the girl.</h6><hr>
  <p>A young Cage gets caught snooping around his grandfather's attic (John Adams Gates played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001626/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Christopher Plummer</a>) during an intense thunderstorm. A sweet montage unfolds wherein Cage's grandfather tells a story of treasure long hunted by everyone and protected by the Knights Templar and later the Free Masons. Cage's father (played by <a href="">Jon Voight</a>) is dismissive of this tall-tale.</p>
  <p>The stage has been set for Cage to grow up and become a treasure hunter. He's running around solving century old riddles/puzzles with the same ease as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Langdon">Robert Langdon</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code">The DaVinci Code</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Demons">Angels and Demons</a>. A grown up Cage is traversing that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I was hoping it was the Antarctic so we could see penguins...">arctic tundra</span> where he and his crew fall on a vast open snow field. What's the logical next step? Get out a residential grade metal detector and start scouring the snowfield for metal. Said detector chimes after a short while and Cage is able to surface a ship's bell after only a few swings of an ice ax. So a ship that has been lost for centuries is only a couple feet below loose snow in the arctic tundra...right.</p>
  <p>The ship is searched only for them to find an old tobacco pipe. Cage disassembles  it and uses the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="his blood. He cut's his thumb. This couldn't wait until they'd returned to a warm place?">best source of ink available</span> to reveal the message of the pipe shaft when rolled out. Cage's financier (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000293/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Sean Bean</a>) attempts to leave them stranded. Cage and his partner (an annoying wiseass played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0058581/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Justin Bartha</a>) escape by blowing up the ship they're in, which is chock full of gunpowder.</p>
  <p>Cage and Bartha try to warn authorities of Bean's plan to steal The Declaration of Independence, but nobody is convinced. So, Cage steals it. They develop their plan to steal it using blueprints of security systems for The Library of Congress that are publicly available....that makes no sense. During this heist sequence, Bartha counts down from 5 to inform Cage of a security camera feed switch, which happens when he hits 3! Nobody counts down from 5 to trigger an event at 3. Bartha you rookie!</p>
  <p>The blond historian (love interest of Cage in the movie) get's kidnapped by Bean's henchman. Cage <a data-reveal-id="ConAir">saves the f*ckin day</a> by rescuing her during a car chase (which, of course, had to happen). Now <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000172/?ref_=tt_cl_t6">Harvey Keitel</a> shows up as that lead FBI investigator. This movie has a serious cast (it does have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/reviews?ref_=tt_urv">solid IMDB reviews</a>...)</p>
  <p>Cage's rookie move of paying for a copy of the Declaration of Independence with a credit card makes him easily traceable by the authorities. Cage evades the authorities and ends up helping Bean, to a point. They find a huge cavern under a church near Wallstreet - a cavern that was until no undiscovered until now. I guess it was below a church....</p>
  <p>Things get dicey on the old wood scaffolding and Cage pulls a line from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103639/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Aladdin</a> asking the blond if "She trust him". Only, Cage drops the blond instead of lifting her onto a magic carpet. Cage sends Bean on a wild-goose-chase to Boston while he and crew discover the real hidden treasure behind a door that was opened using the pipe found on the ship at the beginning. Smooth Cage saves the f*ckin' day and finds treasure!</p>
  <p>A solid Cage performance that lands in the upper quartile of his performances. I would have given it 8 cages, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756522/">Little Einsteins</a> automatically queued up to play next on <a href="http://www.netflix.com"></a>Netflix, which says something about the target audience of this film.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: I'm gonna save the f*ckin' day.</h3>
  <h6 align="center">They were deadly on the ground, now they have wings - "Con Air" poster</h6><hr>
  <p>One of the iconic Cage performances from the pinnacle of his career. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118880/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv">Con Air</a> has an all-star cast where none of them knew what was going on because the script was rewritten nearly every day. Cage traveled to Alabama to perfect his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="This was my reason for not giving this a 10 Cages rating. I'm wondering why, after the first table read, nobody suggested that Cage drop the Southern accent. It's not important to the story or character.">accent</span> and perfected his physique. Cage is in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="He worked out/lifted weights between takes">best shape ever!</span> Malkovich refuses to be interviewed about the movie because he has no idea how his character would turn out. This movie takes off and does not stop until the very end. It's an action movie in every sense of the word - complete with gaping plot holes and incredible one-liners. I once heralded this incredible entry in the Cage Cannon as truly great. Simon Pegg claims it's the "Greatest Movie of All Time" in <a href="">How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</a>, and he makes a solid point.</p>
    <iframe id="iFrame" align="middle" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ekakWBxspA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Poor Poe/Cage is persuaded into pleading guilty to manslaughter by a terrible lawyer. I'm thinking this lawyer was just lazy and had a tee time he didn't want to miss. Also, no judicial system would convict and sentence a defendant to 7 years for a death that resulted from a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Poe/Cage could have very easily avoided this by just getting in the car, and/or not stepping away from the car allowing the three redneck dick jockeys to surround him.">self-defense situation</span>. But, Poe/Cage is a deadly weapon, so off to prison he goes where we get to see a voiced-over montage of letter reading/writing between Poe and his daughter. Also, Poe f*cking loves Cooler Ranch Doritos. This is also the montage where we see Cage's hair transition from 'Legend' to 'Majestic'.</p>
  <p>Finally, Poe's day for parole comes. Of course his cell mate 'Bubba Gump' is being transferred but states he will never see <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="It seemed like they were implying this because Bubba is black">parole papers</span>. Cut to a silk suited Cusack in sandals with socks, and a montage of character introductions all of which are famous criminals with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="It's a bit disappointing that criminals no longer have nicknames...">nicknames</span>. Diamond Dog (Ving Rames) plays a white-hating dude that blew up an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which, even in 1997, I think is an understandable action.">NRA meeting</span>. Malkovich has some of the best lines, and plays his character flawlessly, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="due to the aforementioned constant script re-writing">even though he had no idea what was going on.</span> Chappelle was unaffected by rewrites, as he improvised nearly all his lines. Danny Trejo plays perhaps the worst person on the planet as Johnny 23. Cusack and Meaney get into a heated argument about the undercover DEA agent having a gun on board the flight. Cusack states that there aren't any guns on board, except for in a lockbox kept in the cockpit. The discussion kind becomes a solid argument for <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="If nobody has a gun, then the rationale in needing one for 'protection' doesn't hold up.">gun control</span>. But, we later learn that Cusack was way off on that statement when the convicts pull a small arsenal out of the belly of the plane - complete with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which are incredibly useful in airborn firefights occuring within a single plane.">grenade launchers.</span></p>
  <p>At one point, Poe/Cage does try to get psychological on Diamond Dog - asking him why he's taking orders from some white dude. Dog doesn't bite, stating, "It's a means to an end". Tough break for Cage. That tactic may have worked on a lesser criminal, but he's stuck with some high caliber convicts that aren't going to fall for elementary psychological ploys.</p>
  <p>Cage is given multiple opportunities to get away from the circus that is 'Con Air', but classy Cage elects to stick to his friend Bubba and get him a needle for a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Because if there's a diabetic person, they're likely to be black - only keeping in line with the overtly racist elements in this movie">much-needed insulin injection</span>. His search throughout Lerner airfield leads to a medic kit full of onions and chicken feet, and finally to find some needles in the 'bone yard' where all the army/law enforcement are getting mowed down by Cyrus and the crew of convicts. Cusack saves the day by <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I looked into this, according to 'wikihow' you need a charge on the battery. From Cusack's original attempt to start the truck it seems as though the battery was dead. So, hotwiring wouldn't work. But, it still plays.">hotwiring a truck that wouldn't start</span>. Cage feels compelled to make it back to the plane through the boneyard as well. I don't understand why everyone takes this specific route when there are miles of open desert that are perfectly fine to drive on!  There are literally 360 degrees of access to Lerner airfield, but everyone drives through the same ominous canyon of plane and truck parts to get to the airfield.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, Garland/Buscemi wanders off like a lost child to find a young girl having a tea party in a drained pool. So, not only is this airfield in the middle of nowhere - 50 miles from anything, but there's also a dilapidated trailer park too! The tranquility of the said mobile home park is not broken by the multiple explosions occurring nearby. Not a single resident  appears (other than the girl). Buscemi is creepy as f*ck in this scene.</p>
  <p>Once the plane has been pulled from the earth by some strong convicts, it quickly gets <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="but not before destroying Meaney's classic Corvette by towing into the air traffic control tower.">airborne</span>. We get the classic line from <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="see below">Buscemi</span>, and the plane is forced to land on the Vegas airstrip. The movie really could have ended easily at Lerner airfield, but someone higher up decided "No, this has to end with the plane landing on the 'Strip' in Vegas. There's simply no other way!". Cyrus and a few others escape resulting in a climactic firetruck, police motorcycle chase scene. Cage, as promised, 'save's the f*ckin' day' and the bunny from going down the sewer.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Biceps Make you a Man</h3><h6 align="center">Crispin cuts some rug while Coppola works out on the beach.</h6><hr>
  <p>Cage's first billed appearance (as Nicolas Copolla...before he became Nic Cage) helped him prepare for his role in <a data-reveal-id="RedRockWest">Red Rock West</a> (both required him to do one-handed pushups). After a long day of inhaling fumes from refinishing a floor, I can safely say watching this 48-minute atrocity killed more brain cells than the prior 10 hours of noxioius fume inhalation. Also, the audio and video weren't in sync - which is like enduring lag in real life. Thankfully the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQdJX8ZmLTk&list=WL&index=1">full video</a> is available on youtube so I didn't have to pay any money to see it. Said movie was sponsored by <a href="http://www.charmin.com/en-us">Charmin</a>, which I would recommend you procure to help wipe the sh*tty memory of this piece of garbage from your memory. If you don't, you'll start wondering just how this catastrophe was made, which will cause an aneurysm and you will suffer from the most tragic death in human history.</p>
  <p>This "made for TV movie" (complete with a sh*t-ass laugh track) follows the lives of a group of teenagers in an attempt to explain why their lives aren't as easy as their parents and other adults would think.  A series of disconnected vignettes only undermine the point <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="These teenagers have no responsbility - let alone take any for their frivolous actions involving theft, distruction of property, and general untidiness.">Crispin is trying to make</span>. When Crispin and his cronies are shot down for trying to redeem a ton of bottles they turn into a D-List stomp crew - making music out of convenience store items. At the end of their ear-bleeding performance, they just run out of the store with a bunch of items - stealing! Later, Crispin has the audacity to ask the store owner to donate snacks for this dance. F*cking teenagers! </p>
  <p>Cage is the "cool athletic dude" that gives advice to Kevin about how to score dates with women. Cage attributes most of his success with women to his biceps, which Kevin doesn't have. A terrible dialogue ensues (slightly more terrible than the rest of the lines in this movie...slightly). There were too many bad lines to document in this, as pretty much every line uttered was cringe worthy. If you're still curious you can subject yourself to just the cage parts.</p>

  <p>There's another random "musical" number in which the women complain about the price of designer jeans and sexually assault Crispin while making a mess of a department store. And yet another musical scene where Crispin and cronies are conducting a car wash - terribly. They sing and dance but do very little actual washing of cars. Cage/Coppola goes so far as to damage the underside of one of the cars.</p>
  <p>In perhaps the worst case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall">Breaking the 4th Wall</a> (if you want to see a compliation of well done 4th wall breaking watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLAaUvsKljc">this</a>) ever filmed, Cage has a monolog where opens up about his concern about going to war in El Salvador. Cage/Coppola wonders why wars aren't fought in nice places, like the French Riveria. Cage/Coppola points to his biceps as proof of his manhood - exempting him from selective service. Cage/Coppola does exploit this scenario by using it to make women feel sorry for him - that sly dog!</p>
  <p>Cage/Coppola lacked his manicured mane of chest hair, but he was in top physical form. Erin also noticed his jean shorts (jorts) had "dick wear" pattern in the crotch. That's right he wore them so much that his man bits created a wear pattern. Despite Cage/Copolla's physique and feathered hair I cannot recommend anybody watch this trainwreck "after school special".</a></p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: So Refreshing</h3><h6 align="center">Cage is no hill of beans in this.</h6><hr>
  <p>A contemplative and sorrowful Cage works as a weatherman in Chicago, known for his catchphrase the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="The coldest day/temperature of the week.">"Spritz Nipper"</span>. He drives a Volvo (not a beige one) and has to deal with his hypercritical father the separation from his wife.</p>
  <p>Cage's monolog/voiceover is outstanding. Similar to that of <a data-reveal-id="Adaptation">Adaptation</a>. His self-loathing/deprecating and vocalized observations are what make his character all the more entertaining. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Michale Caine</a> also plays an incredible aloof yet critical father figure. </p>
  <p>Cage is constantly trying to please his father and two children who mostly live with is ex-wife. His Daughter briefly takes up archery, but quickly loses interest when she realizes that she won't be killing animals anytime soon. Cage, in turn, does take up archery and becomes a regular Robin Hood.</p>
  <p>A flashback reveals that Cage thinks he could have salvaged his crumbling marriage by remembering the tartar sauce when picking up take-out. Yeah, it's often the "little things" that erode a relationship - f*cking tartar sauce!</p>
  <p>When Cage gets the offer from "Hello, America!" (Basically <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/entertainment/tv/good-morning-america.htm">Good Morning America</a>) he takes his daughter shopping in New York for more conservative attire to mitigate the name calling of his daughter (camel toe). Innocently, his daughter takes the name as a compliment because camel toes are tough - able to survive long treks across dry rocky terrain.</p>
  <p>Caine has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_funeral">Living Funeral</a> where Cage's speech is cut short due to a power outage. He walks out, takes some soothing zen archery shots before turning and drawing an arrow at his ex-wife's fiance - but doesn't shoot. Cage realizes the fast food thrown at him is ironic and allegorical, in that he himself is fast food - providing no actual nutrition or substance for people, only empty calories.</p>
  <p>This is no action-tastic Cage, but it's a solid performance. I wish he had honed this type of character more for <a data-reveal-id="LeavingLasVegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a>. Oh, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396558/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">Nicholas Hoult</a> is in this!</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Let's Riiiide!</h3><h6 align="center">I was a bit worried about having seen the sequel first. After a few minutes, I becamse more worried about how I was going to survive this movie.</h6><hr>
  <p><img align="right"src="images/GhostRider_images/GhostRider_Hair.jpg">According to IMDB, Cage is a huge fan of Ghost Rider and lobbied hard to play the role. He's such a fan that he has a Ghost Rider tattoo, which had to be covered up for his role. While Cage was born the role, his hair wasn't. The hair piece required 3 hours to apply every day.</p>
  <p>The Devil, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001228/?ref_=tt_cl_i4">Peter Fonda</a> shows up when a young Cage/Johnny Blaze discovers his dad has cancer. Expectedly, the Devil offers a young Cage a deal. The Devil get's Cage's soul and his dad is cured. However, the Devil is a huge dick and kills his father the following day.</p>
  <p>Grownup Blaze/Cage (in full Bieber Hair) eats jelly beans out of a martini glass and acts just a big unhinged (Cage was born for this role!) while drinking piping hot coffee right out of the pot. All this occurs to give us the impression that Blaze has no regard for his life. That is, until cleave...I mean Eva Mendes shows up. Cage woo's Mendes and her cleavage some sweet motorcycle tricks that end up causing a massive traffic jam on the freeway. All of the victims of said jam are elated to see Cage and ask for autographs instead of beating him senseless for his stupidity.</p>
  <p>Cage stands up Mendes a second time when he turns into the Rider which is license for Cage to have epic freakouts (again, he was born for this role). We see a glimpse of a shirtless Cage in the mirror where he's ripped. At first I thought it was just a body double, or every time Cage does a southern accent he gets ripped. I was disappointed to learn that they just used CGI to give Cage his <a data-reveal-id="ConAir">Con Air</a> body. Meanwhile, Mendes get's ripped on wine at some local restaurant. After plowing through a couple bottles, she consults the <a href="">Magic 8-ball</a> she apparently carries around in her purse.</p>
  <p>Eventually the "Epic Showdown" occurs over <a href="http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/Contract_of_San_Venganza">The Contract of San Venganza</a>, which the Devil's Son is after (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004747/?ref_=tt_cl_i12">Wes Bently/American Beauty dude</a>) so he can take over the world. Cage and him duke it out for a while with Cage throwing fireballs at him. If said contract is on paper (like every evil document in this movie) couldn't Cage just burn it when he's the rider? He is made of fire, after all. </p>
  <p>Cage is victorious and gets the girl. The Devil offers to relieve him of his curse, but Cage decides to keep it. Consequently, the Devil is pissed, which makes us wonder why he just can't take the curse back - he is the Devil...</p>
  <p>This is basically  just Cage in full leather for nearly 2 hours. Occasionally freaking out and turning into a flaming motorcycle demon that takes the souls of bad people and saving good people (which includes <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2313103/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t24">Rebel Wilson/Fat Amy</a>).</p>

   <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: What the F*ck?</h3><h6 align="center">What the actual F*ck...</h6><hr>
  <p>An apathetic Cage breaks up with Laura Dern over the phone - not classy Cage! Not classy at all!  I was able to follow the movie up through their discussion. Once that was over I was totally lost.</p>
  <p>I can't claim to follow or be a fan of <a href="http://www.davidlynch.com/">David Lynch</a>, if I harbored any interest in Lynch it would have died with the viewing of this trainwreck. Great Odin's Raven this was bad. Thank Loki it was only 48 minutes.</p>
  <p>I'm supposing this movie was billed as an "artistic piece". I subscribe the Ron Swanson view/criticism of art where "Anything is anything" -  except this piece of garbage movie. There's some dude floating around the stage on wires while a half naked woman climbs around the stage making out with inanimate objects.</p>
  <p>A midget shows up and starts sawing logs in a Fedora while wearing platform shoes, why? because why not. "Anything is anything". All this occurs while a blond version of <a href="http://www.officiallizaminnelli.com/">Liza Minnelli</a> hangs from wires and sings operatically. Said singer eventually falls and I was hopeful that would be the end of this trainwreck, but upon checking the runtime at the point I discovered there was still a solid 15 minutes left if this eye-bleeding performance. Lynch missed a golden opportunity here. Cage is a known opera enthusiast and has no issue with strutting around in his undies while singing operatically (see <a data-reval-id-"TheFamilyMan">The Family Man</a>)</p>
  <p>The fedora-donning midget from earlier performs a soliloquy accompanied by an oboe and a woman moving seductively. Then, the "Blondie Minelli" comes back from the dead to sing some more.</p>
  <p>Cage is hardly in this. I just grew progressively more upset at how utterly random and idiotic this pompous turd of a movie was.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Sooo trippindicular</h3>
  <h6 align="center">"It's awesome!" - Roger Ebert</h6><hr>
 <p>The first movie where Nic Coppola is billed as Nic Cage! The script was apparently written in 10 days, wich is about 9.5 days longer than I would have guessed it took. Producers aimed to make it based off Frank Zappa's Single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-LArv-sEQU">Valley Girl</a>, but Zappa declined to be involved. Zappa later sued and lost the case.</p>
 <p>The opening involves high school girls running up <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="$477 in 2015 dollars">"astronomical" $200 credit card bills</span> while shopping at the mall. I guess this is what people in "the valley" do for fun. Post credit card swiping montage there's some incoherent mumbling around a food court table that I think is supposed to set up/foreshadow the direction of the movie, but since the dialogue was incomprehensible and laced with valley lingo I couldn't discern the subject of the conversation very well. Julie (the main character) breaks up with her hot, but dumb boy toy Tommy for nebulous reasons.</p>
 <p>Soon enough it cuts to the obligatory beach seen where we get our first glimpse of Cage with a perfectly manicured triangular mane of chest hair. Cage's friend gets wind of a party in "the valley", but Randy/Cage isn't in the "mood" to go to the valley.  At said party, Tommy basically sexually assaults Loryn (Julie's friend) the night he's dumped by Julie. Tommy accomplishes this by guilt-tripping her into feeling sympathetic for his recently dumped ass. Tommy, in true form, undoes Loryn's bra so the audience gets a nice glimpse of her boobs 15 minutes in. Tommy freaks out when she asks if they're dating now and leaves, only to find Randy hitting it off with Julie. So, Tommy throws a punch at Randy and gets his minions to kick him out of the party.</p>
 <p>Randy/Cage returns, although this time he climbs into the second story bathroom window and camps out in the shower stall until Julie inevitably walks in. This is a strange tactic, where he has to endure people smoking weed, and I'm sure a fragrant BM or two.  Randy's efforts prevail and he talks Julie into leaving the party so he can take her to "his side of town". Julie didn't seem the least bit upset that Randy/Cage just appeared in the bathroom.</p>
 <p>There's a nice scene where Julie mumbles incoherently while Cage longingly looks into her eyes. They end up making out while Randy/Cage's friend chases Julie's friend around the car like 4-year-old on a sugar high. After a night on the town, Julie returns home to find her mom doing some crazy yoga position that involves her posing inverted spread eagle with her crotch pointed toward the door. After a nice dating montage, Julie has fallen from grace and starts wearing a leather jacket. Tommy takes notice and pits Julie's friends against her forcing her to choose between her friends and Randy. All of which is accomplished through very little dialog.</p>
 <p>A side plot develops wherein <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="some dude who's friends with Tommy....I think">Skip</span> sort of tries to score with Suzie's (Julie's friends) mom when delivering groceries. A strange somewhat cryptic, but disconnected dialog ensues between Suzie's mom and Skip. Suzie's mom makes a pass at Skip, but he can't oblige since he has more groceries to deliver, and because he's incredibly dumb. Later on Skip is riding to Suzie's house on his sweet bike with the bars flipped up in a "DUI special" configuration. Skip lets himself in and creepily wanders about the house to find a woman showering. Turns out it's Suzie, and her mom walks in on them while they're in the bonezone.</p>
 <p>After that side story has concluded we're back to Julie and her dilemma. She apparently takes solace in a creepy as f*ck clown doll that she sleeps with. Julie decides to break it off with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="I assume this is a conjunction if trippin' and perpendicular?">trippindicular</span> Randy/Cage, but Randy won't give up without a fight. Randy/Cage enters full-on <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="a foreshadowing of what Cage will [d]evolve to later in life?">creeper/stalker mode</span> and shows up in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="basically, different types of glasses">"costume"</span> everywhere Julie and Tommy go. Randy is even camping out on Julie's lawn!</p>
 <p>Cut to prom night where Randy/Cage sneaks in with his sidekick - both donning colored hair (Cage in full punk rock chic hair). Randy beats up Tommy backstage before the king/queen prom announcement. Julie is enamored with Randy's display of unbridled hostility and they run out to the car Julie and Tommy took to prom and the credits roll.</p>
 <p>There are numerous WTF moments peppered throughout this classic Cage performance - from Julie's <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="when looking in the mirror at her busty self">friend forgetting the anatomical name for breasts</span>, to high school girls dancing and lip syncing in their underwear.  Watch it with a friend and take a sip of your favorite beverage every time there's an abrupt and unexplained cut to a different scene.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Believe your eyes, it's bad</h3><h6 align="center">Cage is the sewer king?</h6><hr>
  <p>In a classic case of "Who done it", Cage plays a flippant Atlantic City cop toting a gold cell phone and wearing a loud silk shirt. The plot to this is somewhat like "The Rock", only much less entertaining, but perhaps more Cage-tastic (despite my Cage Rating). Sinise is looking to fast track  weapons deal in order to get redemption/retribution for an attack on a Naval ship. Cage's phone rings off the hook because apparently the cinematography or storyline can't carry any viewer's attention. So, any lull in dialog is filled with Cage's gold phone ringing and talking to either his wife and kid or girlfriend on the side. When met with any confrontation he just shoves his badge in their face and goes about his business.</p>
  <p>The Secretary of defense, a defense contractor, and a military general (played by Gary Sinise) are all attending a boxing match in an Atlantic City Casino. Why, because why not. It turns out that there's a major weapons deal going down, but some young researcher found the test data to be doctored. So, of course, the Secretary of Defense tells her to approach him at the aforementioned boxing match  - not in email form, or telephone. Meet in a busy arena with a bunch of loud people - totally logical. </p>
  <p>It turns out that Sinise is on the plot and kills the Secretary to prevent any hiccups in the arms deal yet to be solidified. One would think that the assassination of the Secretary might present a few hiccups in any large government contract deals, but you'd be wrong! One of the best scenes (that I hope was improved) was Sinise shooting one of henchman. Said victim turns around to see Sinise holding a gun pointed at him and exclaims "I've been shot!".</p>
  <p>Sinise confides in Cage about this top secret weapons deal/system, stating only a handful of people know about it. Later on, it appears the every citizen in the US is aware of the program. Cage is able to piece together his haphazard scheme through viewing of security footage and talking to the young researcher who discovered the doctored data. To keep her safe he locks her in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Why would a utility room be lockable from the only the outside?">some random utility room</span>.</p>
  <p>In reality, the plot was an afterthought. It seems more likely that De Palma and writers just wanted to stick Cage in a venue where he can wander around, freak out, talk on his gold flip phone, and wear loud silk shirts. </p>

  <h6 align="center">"Everyone wears Kimonos, except for Cage. He's too cool for Kimonos"</h6><hr>
  <p>I was beginning to think this movie was my own personal <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="The unstealable car for Cage in 'Gone in 60-Seconds'">"Eleanor"</span>. The best price found was $26 for a VHS. A fellow Cage enthusiast was able to find the full version on <a href="https://youtu.be/FmJ1jVfAID8?list=LLbyhSjLXwRANXhbqd8VYRwg">Youtube</a>. In fact, there are multiple full versions!  Our hunch was that it's so terrible and made so little money that nobody cares about a pirated version being on the web - not even Cage, who is prone to being quite litigious.</p>
  <p>Subtitles would have been helpful, because of the poor quality. There's so much going on this movie, and yet nothing at all. Cage has crap hair extensions to create an "artistic mullet" and facial hair that belongs on a jean shorts wearing roller skater from the 80's. Less than 3 minutes into the movie we are subjected to full frontal nudity. This boldness makes sense since the two first "plot keywords" for the IMDB entry are "pubic hair" and "nudity". I'm fairly certain the casting call for the role of Zandalee was just the head producers in a room asking women the following:
    <ul id="pList">
      <li>Do you run?</li>
      <li>Are you willing be naked for most of the time?</li>
      <li>Are you capable of having zero on-screen chemistry with everyone?</li>
    </ul>
  </p> <blockquote></blockquote>
  <p><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="artistic spelling of the name Terry">Theirry</span> played by <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="henceforth referred to as Neil from his role in 'The Santa Clause'">Judge Reinhold</span> is married to Zandalee. But we learn that he suffers from some sort of self-imposed genital paralysis. My hypothesis is that his disability has something to do with the glitter he carries around in his pocket and the fez he wears in one of the first scenes. I thought "Drive Angry: Shot in 3D" was a schizophrenic bag of garbage. Zandalee is a bunch of random scenes stitched together by an insane <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="because they love sex, and this movie was a ton of sex">bonobo</span>. Neil's dong paralysis is also likely due to the lack of chemistry between him and Zandalee. "Zand" has the personality of a corpse, while she and Neil have the chemistry of an inert gas.</p>
  <p>Zand finds promise in her affair with Johnny/Cage - who is an "artist" but works some sort of blue collar job wherein Neil is his boss. In Johnny's spare time he paints. His art looks comparable to that of a finger painting by colorblind 5-year-old hopped up on Mtn. Dew and Fun Dip.</p>
  <p>During a confusing love scene between Cage and Zand she declares that she won't do drugs. So, Cage cleverly begins to sensually massage her with what I think was Olive Oil mixed with a fat rail of "white lightning" while he finger blasts her.</p>
  <p>Zand eventually calls off the affair. Cage freaks out - creating the iconic scene where he slathers himself in black paint. Zand and Neil (sans fez) go away to reboot their marriage. We learn that Neil's disability is cured by boats n' hoes. Neil's blissful comeback is short lived when creepy stalker Cage shows up on their getaway. Neil and Cage dance for a bit (because, why not). Then, Neil pulls a gun on Cage and Zand. In any other movie, this wouldn't make any sense, but in this erratic piece of cinema it makes just as much sense as every other scene. All three hop in a boat. Neil is firing randomly into the forest, falls out, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="probably because he just can't live with his self-imposed genital paralysis any longer">elects to let himself drown</span></p>
  <p>Shortly after this the credits role and any viewer still paying attention is utterly confused. It's also worth mentioning that a very young <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Cypher from the Matrix">Joe Pantoliano</span> plays a cross-dressing friend of Zandalee (maybe even a coworker?), and Steve Buscemi plays a convict garbage man. Both of the two aforementioned roles exhibit more acting ability than any of the main characters.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: Are you F*cking Cartooning Me!</h3><h6 align="center">Cage get's the sniffles when he gets angry.</h6><hr>
  <p>What the hell was going through the minds of studio executives when they decided to make this schizophrenic piece of garbage? Whatever they were thinking, I'm sure they regretted it when this movie set the record for shortest time from theatrical premiere to DVD release (18 days). More vexing is how they spent $35 million on this! From what I can surmise, Cage somehow sold this to studio execs so he would have the opportunity occasionally kiss and touch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Nicole Kidman</a>.</p>
  <p>Basically, a bunch of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="One of which is the tweaker girlfriend of the ring leader. Another is his backstabbing brother (I'm not sorry for the spoiler!)">halfwits</span> invade Cage/Kidman's home to get diamonds or money (they don't care which). They continually have the upper hand, but can't pull their sh*t together and get the job done. There's countless "red herrings" to lead the viewer astray (assuming the viewer is just as much a halfwit as the burglars). The motivations are continually changing for each character, but you as the viewer, you just don't care.</p>
  <p>If you thought this cinematic disaster couldn't get worse, you thought wrong. There are countless inconsistencies to accompany the idiocy occurring on screen. Kidman wants to have dinner as a family, but Cage is going out on as sales call. Kidman dons a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="She was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. There's absolutely no rationale for the wardrobe change. My guess is that Kidman wrote it into her contract to show off her body, and take attention away from her recent lip job.">black a dress</span> for their stay at home dinner (maybe to get some nook from Cage's character). Kidman's character is sexually frustrated from neglectful Cage, and Cage talks to Kidman like she's 5-years-old.</p>
  <p>Cage is a "busy businessman" too busy selling diamonds to give any attention to Kidman. Their daughter doesn't care about either of her parents and rightly so since some dweeb in a cop costume gains entry to their zombie-proof compound by simply asking to talk to them.</p>
  <p>The ring leader of this sh*t circus tries to play mind games with Cage and Kidman as to his motivation. At first he needs a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="he claims to have a 'kidney broker' too! I'm doubtful those exist...maybe in the Cage Cannon they do.">kidney</span>, then something else (I may have lost  consciousness for a bit due to the lunacy I was watching), then we find out it's because he's indebted to a drug dealer. Meanwhile, ring leader's tweaker girlfriend just disappears herself (I pulled that line from <a data-reveal-id="Stolen">Stolen</a>) to the master bedroom to get high, disrobe, and watch home movies while trying on dresses from Kidman's wardrobe.</p>
  <p>The entire time Cage refuses to open his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Which empty. Spoiler! But you don't care.">safe</span>, then agrees to, then doesn't (this happens too many times to count). The burglar ring-leader responds by threatening to kill Cage or a member of his family. This interaction creates a broken record of cat and mouse, except the record is playing Rebecca Black's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0">Friday</a> (her music video might be better, only because it has a shorter runtime than "Trespass") and both parties are mice  in a near vegetative state after ingesting a near lethal dose of rat poison. It's like everyone involved was instructed to drag this 10-minute short out into a full length "movie". Eventually, we learn that Cage isn't broke but instead is flushed with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Image below is what I assume the movie money looked like for this production">cash</span> that he hid behind a wall in their house (which is still under construction). Which brings me to another point. Who the hell finishes all the landscaping to a property, and part of the house, leaving the other part under construction? Cage also puts up a sheet of drywall with a nail gun, which isn't correct at all! Drywall is secured with screws!</p>
  <img id="modImage" align="center" src="images/CageDollar.jpg">
  <p>This is a sh*tty hybrid of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="As in they are hostages, not kidnapped">Reverse Taken</span> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258000/">Panic Room</a> wherein Cage miraculously survives a gunshot the the femoral artery (<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-quickly-would-someone-die-if-both-of-their-femoral-arteries-were-severed">which any normal human would pass out from after about a minute</a>) to produce the only "Cage Kill" of the movie - with the best employment of a nail gun as a weapon since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000418/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Danny Glover</a> in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097733/">Lethal Weapon 2</a>. Cage also shut down production for a day when he insisted on switching roles (mid-shoot) to become the villain. Filming resumed the following day with Cage keeping his original role - silly Cage!.</p>

  <h3 id="review" align="center">Review: I'd choose Mr. Ed anyday.</h3>
  <h6 align="center">It's a mixture of laughter and tears - Gary Franklin KCOP-TV</h6><hr>
  <p>The reviews on the DVD case were both from Gary Franklin of KCOP-TV. I did a bit of digging, and it seems that Franklin was credited with creating the "Franklin Scale of 1 to 10". I don't mean to discount this local critics accolades, but I'm sure the "1 to 10" scale had been used prior to his meteoric rise on local Los Angeles television.</p>
  <p>Cage is a frustrated Secret Service agent stuck on a lame-ass duty protecting a widowed former first lady, Tess (Played by MacLaine). First of all, the opening credit scene is unecessary. Credits belong at the end of the movie; unless an opening credit montage is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Like Disney's 1973 'Robin Hood' or 'Lord of War' (A Cage joint) ">creative or adds to the story</span>.</p>
  <p>The aforementioned fault aside, Cage does quite well in his role as Doug Chesnic, SAIC.  He tries to leave his duty guarding Tess. With a sense of relief he loosens his tie <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="which provides the real sense of relief when undone, so the undoing of the tie does nothing">but leaves his top button done</span>. Tess has power over even the president and calls him to deal with her struggles regarding secret service protection, and request Doug back on duty as SAIC.  Basically, Tess is a pill that everyone kowtows to - except for good ole' <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="well...sort of. It takes him a while, but he grows a pair">Cage</span>!
  <p>Cage becomes a sad little pony when Tess is kidnapped under his <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="double entendre intended">watch</span>.  But he is resourceful and makes solid use of a chair that he was left with from the kidnapping to wait for his fellow officers to pick him up. Cage goes bananas on the skeezy driver that assisted with the kidnapping by shooting his toe(s) off in a hospital. For not being an action movie, this is one of the best scenes of Cage firing a weapon while executing good dialogue.</p>
  <p>Tess is found, Cage and his men insist on digging Tess out of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="That's right! The kidnappers buried her alive in a barn!">hole she was buried in</span>, and demand a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="WTF is a power saw? That's a nebulous request. Cage should have demanded a corded circular saw so they could set a blade depth and be sure to not hurt Tess.">power saw</span> when they finally unearth the box Tess was buried in. The almost final scene involves a Tess being flown out in a helicopter, only to land. She requests Doug/Cage to accompany her. Said request has to be relayed like a game of telephone because everyone on in this scene forgets they have radios attached to their person.</p>

    I understand about 90% of what <a href="http://timgarrett.info/">Tim </a> has written in this proof. Full credit goes to him for spending valuable reasearch time writing this completely unecessary math proof.
  </div>
  <div class="small-10 columns small-offset-1 columns math-proof end" style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 5px;">
    <h5 style="bold">Claim:</h5>
    <p>There are an uncountably infinite number of sh*tty sequel movie ratings.</p>
    <h5 style="bold">Proof:</h5>
    <p>Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the number of possible shitty movie ratings, is countable. Which implies that there are a countable number of shitty movies better than the last. Then, there exists a bijective function &#402; from the set of natural numbers ℕ={1,2,3,…} to the ratings of sh*tty movies. For example, I put the movie into the function (the third shitty movie) and I get a rating &#402;(3)=0.278, and a subsequent movie is also shitty: &#402;(4)=0.2781, but not as sh*tty. Represent the number after the decimal place as a sequence of binary numbers (I.e. assume they are all in the shitty range [0-1)). Then we have a sequence of sh*tty movies for any sh*tty ratings:<br>
      <center>&#402;(1) = 0.(0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(2) = 0.(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(3) = 0.(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(4) = 0.(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(5) = 0.(0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(6) = 0.(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(7) = 0.(0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>⋮</center><br>
      <center>By construction, let <i>s</i> be a rating that differs from every rating in the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> binary digit. For example:</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(1) = .0(<b>0</b>,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(2) = .0(0,<b>0</b>,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(3) = .0(0,0,<b>0</b>,1,0,0,0,0,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(4) = .0(0,0,0,<b>1</b>,0,0,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(5) = .0(0,1,0,0,<b>0</b>,1,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(6) = .0(0,1,0,1,0,<b>1</b>,0,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>&#402;(7) = .0(0,1,0,1,1,1,<b>0</b>,1,0,&#8230;)</center><br>
      <center>⋮</center><br>
      <center><i>s</i> = 0.(1,1,1,0,1,0,1,…)</center><br>
      Since <i>s</i> differs from each rating at the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> binary digit, <i>s</i> cannot be a rating assigned to a shitty movie. This is a contradiction of the claim, and therefore, there are an uncountably infinite number of shitty sequel movie ratings.
